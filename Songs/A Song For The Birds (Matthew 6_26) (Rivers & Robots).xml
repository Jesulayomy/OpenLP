    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Father God,<br/>All I ever needed was in your plan,<br/>All I ever wanted was in your hands,<br/>Now I don't have to wander so far,<br/>Just to find a well,<br/>for water that does not quench the thirst.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Little birds,<br/>Keep your feathered wings wrapped around your face,<br/>The perfect little coat for a warm embrace,<br/>And spread your wings in flight,<br/>Overhead in the open sky,<br/>The perfect picture, black and white.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>They don't toil and spin,<br/>They don't reap and sow,<br/>They don't store in barns but still the flowers grow,<br/>I put my trust in You,<br/>See all the birds You feed,<br/>My daily bread, my life, for You have all I need.</lines>
