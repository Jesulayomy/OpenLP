    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>And if I told you that somebody did love you, would you say<br/>"Hey show me that face;"<br/>And if I told you that true freedom was actual, would you say<br/>"Hey, take me to that place?"<br/>And if I said there is a family: a body that moves as one;<br/>Do you feel the love that invites us, the liberty excites us,<br/>The disco has just begun, has just begun.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Give me love, give me liberty, disco: a place everybody in the family's found;<br/>On that day, we will all be happy people, when love, liberty, disco's in town.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And as we step into the light of the Lover, we're all the same, there's no rich or poor;<br/>And you know it's never been good for a man to be alone,<br/>So come on in, your name's on the door, what are we waiting for?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>All our fears are turning 'round, fall down, and meet your Maker,<br/>Where our true selves will be found, calling out to every lonely soul.</lines>
    </verse>
