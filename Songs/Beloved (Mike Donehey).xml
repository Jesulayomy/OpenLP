    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Love of My life, look deep in My eyes;<br/>There you will find what you need.<br/>Give Me your life, the lust and the lies,<br/>The past you're afraid I might see.<br/>You've been running away from Me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>You're my beloved, lover I'm yours.<br/>Death shall not part us; it's you I died for.<br/>For better or worse, forever we'll be.<br/>Our love it unites us, and it binds you to Me;<br/>It's a mystery.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Love of My life, look deep in My eyes;<br/>There you will find what you need.<br/>I'm the Giver of Life, I'll clothe you in white;<br/>My immaculate bride you will be.<br/>Oh, come running home to Me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Well you've been a mistress, My wife.<br/>You're chasing lovers, that won't satisfy.<br/>Won't you let Me make you My bride?<br/>You will drink of my lips and you'll taste new life.</lines>
    </verse>
