    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>While o'er our guilty land, O Lord, We view the terrors of Your sword, O where can all the helpless fly? To whom but You direct their cry?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>On You, our guardian God, we call; Before Your throne of grace we fall; But is there no deliv'rance there? And must we perish in despair?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>See, we repent, we weep, we mourn; To our forsaken God we turn; O spare our guilty country, spare The Church which You have planted there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We are the old, the sick, the lame; We blind and deaf cry Jesus' Name. We plead Your mercy for His sake, And trust that You will not forsake.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Christ is our only righteousness, His death for us is our redress. Your promise stronger than our sin; Blot out O Lord what we have been.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>We are your children after all,<br/>Redeemed by Christ after the fall.<br/>Marked with Your Name in Baptism,<br/>Our home remains in Your Kingdom.</lines>
    </verse>
