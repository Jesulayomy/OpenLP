    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Christians awake! Salute the happy morn,<br/>Whereon the Saviour of mankind was born;<br/>Rise to adore the mystery of love<br/>Which hosts of angels chanted from above;<br/>With them the joyful tidings first begun<br/>Of God Incarnate and the Virgin’s Son.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,<br/>Who heard the angelic herald’s voice ‘Behold,<br/>I bring good tidings of a Saviour’s birth<br/>To you and all the nations upon earth:<br/>This day hath God fulfilled His promised word,<br/>This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord.’</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He spake; and straightway the celestial choir<br/>In hymns of joy unknown before conspire;<br/>High praise of God’s redeeming love they sang,<br/>And heaven’s whole orb with hallelujahs rang;<br/>God’s highest glory was their anthem still,<br/>‘On earth be peace, and unto men goodwill.’</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O may we keep and ponder in our mind<br/>God’s wondrous love in saving lost mankind;<br/>Trace we the Babe who hath retrieved our loss,<br/>From His poor manger to His bitter cross;<br/>Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace,<br/>Till man’s first heavenly state again takes place.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Then may we hope, the angelic hosts among,<br/>To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphant song:<br/>He that was born upon this joyful day<br/>Around us all His glory shall display;<br/>Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing<br/>Eternal praise to heaven’s almighty King.</lines>
    </verse>
