    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse: 1<br/>You were a lover before time's beginning<br/>You gave Your love freely with holding nothing,  Jesus, my Jesus<br/>You carried the weight of the world on Your shoulders<br/>You stopped at nothing to prove you were for us,  Jesus, my Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>It's extravagant,  it doesn't make sense<br/>We'll never comprehend, the way You love us<br/>It's unthinkable,  only heaven knows<br/>Just how far You'd go,  to say You love us  (To say You love us)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse: 2<br/>You don't belittle our pain and our suffering<br/>You comfort us in our greatest unraveling,  Jesus, my Jesus<br/>You are the dawn that is breaking within me<br/>You are the sun that is rising around me,  Jesus, my Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>Here is all my love<br/>It's yours, no conditions<br/>When you pull me close, no I won't resist</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>It's extravagant,  it doesn't make sense<br/>We'll never comprehend, the way You love us<br/>It's unthinkable,  only heaven knows<br/>Just how far You'd go,  to say You love us  (To say You love us)</lines>
