      <lines>Find me here, speak to me.<br/>I want to feel you, I need to hear you.<br/>You are the light that's leading me<br/>To the place where I find peace again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You are the strength that keeps me walking.<br/>You are the hope that keeps me trusting.<br/>You are the light to my soul.<br/>You are my purpose, You're everything.</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>How can I stand here with You and not be moved by You?<br/>Would You tell me how could it be any better than this?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You calm the storms and You give me rest.<br/>You hold me in your hands, You won't let me fall.<br/>You steal my heart, You take my breath away.<br/>Would you take me in? Take me deeper now?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Cause You're all I want, You're all I need.<br/>You're everything, everything. (4X)</lines>
