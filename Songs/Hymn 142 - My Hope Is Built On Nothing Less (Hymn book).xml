    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness;<br/>I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When darkness veils His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace.<br/>In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His oath, His covenant, His blood<br/>support me in the whelming flood;<br/>When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may I then in Him be found;<br/>Dressed in His righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>On Christ, the solid rock I stand;<br/>All other ground is sinking sand,<br/>All other ground is sinking sand.</lines>
    </verse>
