    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus, He came to love, heal, and forgive;<br/>He lived and died to buy my pardon;<br/>An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,<br/>Because He lives, all fear is gone;<br/>Because I know He holds the future,<br/>And life is worth the living just because He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How sweet to hold a newborn baby and feel the pride and joy he gives;<br/>But greater still the calm assurance<br/>This child can face uncertain days because He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,<br/>Because He lives, all fear is gone;<br/>Because I know He holds the future,<br/>And life is worth the living just because He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And then one day I'll cross that river; I'll fight life's final war with pain;<br/>And then as death gives way to vict'ry,<br/>I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,<br/>Because He lives, all fear is gone;<br/>Because I know He holds the future,<br/>And life is worth the living just because He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
