    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is a river running deep in your soul<br/>It's the power of God, can't you feel it flow?<br/>You've got a glory that can light up the dark<br/>You've got the Kingdom of God in your heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>You can go now, you can go<br/>You've got the treasure that the world needs to know<br/>You can go now, you can go<br/>You've got the power of God, let it flow</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You've got a promise from your Father above<br/>There is nothing on this earth that can stop His love<br/>You are the light He wants to set on a hill<br/>You are the one who can walk in His will</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>You can go now, you can go<br/>You've got the treasure that the world needs to know<br/>You can go now, you can go<br/>You've got the power of God, let it flow</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>With the prize before and the cross behind<br/>In the power of God and the name that binds<br/>You can walk in faith, you can always know<br/>When the Lord puts love in your heart, it will flow</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>You can go now, you can go<br/>You've got the treasure that the world needs to know<br/>You can go now, you can go<br/>You've got the power of God, let it flow</lines>
