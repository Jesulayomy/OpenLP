    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Today I finally found a melody that fits,<br/>A melody that fits.<br/>Today I finally found a song that I can sing,<br/>A song that I can sing.</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>You are my King, You are my King;<br/>I bow down before You and crown You the King of all Kings.<br/>Forever I'll sing, forever I'll sing:<br/>I'll sing of Your mercy and how I have been set free.<br/>I'm set free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The rulers of the earth will bow before Your throne,<br/>They'll bow before Your throne.<br/>The nations You have made will worship You alone,<br/>They'll worship You alone...They'll sing for You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I'm set free.<br/>I'm set free.<br/>I'm set free.<br/>If the King has set you free... you are free indeed.<br/>If the King has set you free... you are free indeed.</lines>
