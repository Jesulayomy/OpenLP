    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We give Thee but Thine own, Whate'er the gift may be; All that we have is Thine alone, A trust, O Lord, from Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>May we Thy bounties thus As stewards true receive, And gladly, as Thou blessest us, To Thee our firstfruits give.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O hearts are bruised and dead, And homes are bare and cold, And lambs for whom the Shepherd bled Are straying from the fold.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>To comfort and to bless, To find a balm for woe, To tend the lone and fatherless Is angels' work below.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>The captive to release, To God the lost to bring, To teach the way of life and peace? It is a Christlike thing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>And we believe Thy Word,<br/>Though dim our faith may be;<br/>Whate'er for Thine we do, O Lord,<br/>We do it unto Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
