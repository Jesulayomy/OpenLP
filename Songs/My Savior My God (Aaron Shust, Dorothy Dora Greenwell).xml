  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I am not skilled to understand<br/>What God has willed, what God has planned.<br/>I only know at His right hand<br/>Stands one who is my Savior.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I take Him at His word and deed.<br/>Christ died to save me this I read.<br/>And in my heart I find a need<br/>Of Him to be my Savior.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>That He would leave His place on high<br/>And come for sinful man to die,<br/>You count it strange, so once did I,<br/>Before I knew my Savior.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>My Savior loves. My Savior lives.<br/>My Savior's always there for me.<br/>My God He was. My God He is.<br/>My God is always gonna be. (2X)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Yes, living, dying let me bring<br/>My strength, my solace<br/>from this spring:<br/>That He who lives to be my King<br/>Once died to be my Savior.</lines>
    </verse>
