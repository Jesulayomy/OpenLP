    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin.<br/>I wouldn't let my dear Saviour in.<br/>Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night.<br/>Praise The Lord, I saw the Light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I saw the Light, I saw the Light,<br/>No more darkness, No more night.<br/>Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight.<br/>Praise the Lord, I saw the Light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Just like the blind man, I wandered along,<br/>Worries and fears, I claimed for my own.<br/>Then like the blind man, that God, gave back his sight.<br/>Praise the Lord, I saw the Light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I was a fool to wander and stray,<br/>For straight is the gate and narrow the way.<br/>Now I have traded, the wrong for the right.<br/>Praise the Lord, I saw the Light.</lines>
    </verse>
