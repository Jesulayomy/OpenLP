    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A corner office was his dream</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>More like a prison now it seems<br/>Somewhere on the corporate climb</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He left his warrior behind<br/>Now hes just a worker at a daily grind</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Steals his years and numbs his mind<br/>His strength is fading, his dreams are blind</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>This is not the life he had in mind</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>She lies awake cause hes up all night</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Staring at a screen that tells him lies<br/>That the grass is greener on the other side<br/>So shes at the gym fighting off the years</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>To be young again and calm her fears<br/>That shell never be enough for him<br/>Just as a young man catches her eye</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>Now they're trapped in their own worlds, in their own wars<br/>With their cell phones and the closed doors<br/>It's funny how quiet and peaceful that it seems<br/>But they're all alone together<br/>In the house of their dreams</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>Little sister, shes a sixteen-year-old princess</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>Lost somewhere between the swing set<br/>And her brand new crushs chariot awaits<br/>And big brothers rooms glowing with trophies that shout his name<br/>But he'd trade all his high school fame<br/>For some backyard catch with his hero again</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>Now they're trapped in their own worlds, in their own wars<br/>With their cell phones and the closed doors<br/>It's funny how quiet and peaceful that it seems<br/>But they're all alone together<br/>In the house of their dreams</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v13">
      <lines>So now they're all dressed up in sunday best<br/>Sit up straight just like the rest<br/>And they sing the songs of peace and rest that Jesus freely gives</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v14">
      <lines>And then their kids look up as daddy stands</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v15">
      <lines>And he takes his bride with trembling hands<br/>Brother kneels at his fathers side as princess looks in the mothers eyes<br/>Their tears tear down the walls as daddy prays</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v16">
      <lines>Now they're trapped in their own worlds, in their own wars<br/>With their cell phones and the closed doors<br/>It's funny how quiet and peaceful that it seems<br/>But they're all alone together<br/>In the house of their dreams</lines>
