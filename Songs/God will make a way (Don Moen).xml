    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God will make a way,<br/>where there seems to be no way;<br/>He works in ways we cannot see,<br/>He will make a way for me.<br/>He will be my guide,<br/>hold me closely to His side;<br/>with love and strength<br/>for each new day,<br/>He will make a way,<br/>He will make a way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>By a road way in the wilderness<br/>He'll lead me.<br/>And rivers in the desert will I see<br/>Heaven and Earth will fade,<br/>but His Word will still remain<br/>And He will do something new today</lines>
