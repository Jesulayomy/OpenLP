    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I knew I was broken but there was no one that I could tell, mmmmm<br/>Praying felt like I was throwing pennies in a wishing well<br/>And I started believing I was cursed to carry this weight<br/>I was listing the reasons of why I should walk away</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Until gra-a-a-ace called my na-a-a-ame<br/>Oh, I didn't know I could be free until grace found me<br/>Until gra-a-a-ace broke these cha-a-a-ains<br/>Oh, I didn't know I could be free<br/>    C# N.C.<br/>Until grace found, Your grace found me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I might be looking at a future full of question marks, mmmmm<br/>But I don't to have all of the answers if You have my heart<br/>In You I'm finding redemption a little more with every breath<br/>Brand new like the morning and I'll never forget that...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>CHORUS:<br/>Until gra-a-a-ace called my na-a-a-ame<br/>Oh, I didn't know I could be free until grace found me<br/>Until gra-a-a-ace broke these cha-a-a-ains<br/>Oh, I didn't know I could be free<br/>Until grace found, Your grace found me<br/>    (Your grace found meee-ee-eee-eeeeeeeeee)</lines>

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>    Ohhh ohhhhh ohhhhhhhhh<br/>BREAK:<br/>You came like force of nature, knocked down every wall I made<br/>You rescued my soul when I thought there was no escape, no</lines>

      <lines>CHORUS:<br/>Until gra-a-a-ace, oh oh oh oh oh<br/>    (Uh, tell it to Him)<br/>Until grace, until grace called my na-a-a-ame<br/>Oh, I didn't know I could be free until grace found me<br/>Until gra-a-a-ace broke these cha-a-a-ains (Broke these chains)<br/>I didn't know I could be free<br/>Until grace found, Your grace found meee-ee-eee yeah (and found me, ooh ooh)<br/>Oh, thank You, Jesus<br/>Your grace found me</lines>
