    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He was pierced for our transgressions,<br/>He was crushed for our sins.<br/>The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him.<br/>And by His wounds, by His wounds we are healed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>We are healed by Your sacrifice,<br/>In the life that You gave.<br/>We are healed for You paid the price,<br/>By Your grace we are saved,<br/>We are saved.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>And by His wounds, by His wounds.<br/>What can wash away my sin?<br/>Nothing but the blood of Jesus.</lines>
