    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>One day when heaven was filled with His praises,<br/>One day when sin was as black as could be,<br/>Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin-<br/>Dwelt among men, my example is He!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;<br/>Buried, He carried my sins far away;<br/>Rising, He justified freely forever:<br/>One day He's coming-O glorious day!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain,<br/>One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;<br/>Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;<br/>Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>One day they left Him alone in the garden,<br/>One day He rested, from suffering free;<br/>Angels came down o'er His tomb to keep vigil;<br/>Hope of the hopeless, my Savior is He.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,<br/>One day the stone rolled away from the door;<br/>Then He arose, over death He had conquered;<br/>Now is ascended, my Lord evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,<br/>One day the skies with His glory will shine;<br/>Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;<br/>Glorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!</lines>
    </verse>
