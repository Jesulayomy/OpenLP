    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I can't do anything, I can't do anything without You.<br/>But You can do anything, You can do anything You want.<br/>And I just can't belive, I can't belive that You would love me,<br/>After everything, after everything I've done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And I want to love You, love You more than life itself<br/>And I want to hold You, even though You can't be held,<br/>Because You're so much more than everything I've ever known,<br/>Anything, anything.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'd give anything, I would give anything to hold You.<br/>I want to live for You, for You alone I want to live.<br/>When I see Your face, I would do anything to know You.<br/>You gave everything, You gave everything to give.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Halle, Hallelujah,<br/>Halle, Hallelujah,<br/>Halle, Hallelujah,<br/>Halle</lines>
