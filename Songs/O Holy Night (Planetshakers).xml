  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O holy night, the stars are brightly shining;<br/>It is the night of the dear Savior's birth.<br/>Long lay the world in sin and error pining,<br/>Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.<br/>A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,<br/>For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Fall on your knees,<br/>Oh, hear the angel voices!<br/>O night divine,<br/>O night when Christ was born!<br/>O night, O holy night, O night divine!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,<br/>With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.<br/>O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,<br/>Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.<br/>The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;<br/>In all our trials born to be our friends.<br/>He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,<br/>Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Truly He taught us to love one another,<br/>His law is love and His gospel is peace.<br/>Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.<br/>And in his name all oppression shall cease.<br/>Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,<br/>With all our hearts we praise His holy name.<br/>Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,<br/>His power and glory ever more proclaim!</lines>
    </verse>
