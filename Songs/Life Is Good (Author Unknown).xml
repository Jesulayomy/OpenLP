    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Life is good with You, Lord, with You, Lord.<br/>Life is bad when I'm away from You.<br/>Life is good with You, Lord, with You, Lord.<br/>Show me the bad and show me the good.<br/>Help me keep my eyes on You!<br/>See I've been thinkin'...'bout my Jesus.<br/>How He saved me and how He gave me this life above.<br/>And I remember...that sacrifice of glory.<br/>How He saught me and how He bought me with His unfailing love -<br/>and now I'm singin':<br/>I was alone when You met me.<br/>I was on my own and I had no home.<br/>I was dark and deep in doubt.<br/>Then You showed me gentleness and mercy.<br/>You turned me around; I was lost and now I'm found.<br/>And now I walk this road again.<br/>See I was thinkin'...'bout my situation.<br/>I was wantin' the things that this world brings,<br/>Thinking maybe God wasn't enough.<br/>Then it hit me: that sacrifice of glory<br/>Was sent to heal me, so He would lead me,<br/>And then show me the love from above.</lines>
