    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>'Twas on that dark, that doleful night When pow'rs of earth and hell arose Against the Son of God's delight, And friends betrayed Him to His foes:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Before the mournful scene began, He took the bread, and blessed, and brake: What love through all His actions ran! What wondrous words of grace He spake!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>"This is My body, broke for sin; Receive and eat the living food:" Then took the cup, and blessed the wine; "'Tis the new cov'nant in My blood."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For us His flesh with nails was torn, He bore the scourge, He felt the thorn; And justice poured upon His head Its heavy vengeance in our stead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>For us His vital blood was spilt, To buy the pardon of our guilt, When, for black crimes of biggest size, He gave His soul a sacrifice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>"Do this," He cried, "till time shall end,<br/>In memory of your dying friend;<br/>Meet at My table, and record<br/>The love of your departed Lord."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Jesus, Thy feast we celebrate,<br/>We show Thy death, we sing Thy name,<br/>Till Thou return, and we shall eat<br/>The marriage supper of the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
