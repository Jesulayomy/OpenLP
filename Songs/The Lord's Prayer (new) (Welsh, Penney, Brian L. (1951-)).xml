    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Father in heaven, Your name we confess, High and exalted in bright holiness; O may Your kingdom come, Your will be done, And may the earth and heav'n be joined as one.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O Father, now our daily bread supply, And grant forgiveness for iniquity; May we forgive as we have been forgiv'n, Our hearts with mercy filled, as Yours in heav'n.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O Father, lead us from temptation's pow'r; May we find safety from sin's trying hour; I Lord, deliver from the evil one, All this we ask through Your beloved Son.</lines>
