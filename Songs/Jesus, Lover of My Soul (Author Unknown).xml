    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus, lover of my soul,<br/>All consuming fire is in Your gaze.<br/>Jesus, I want You to know<br/>I will follow You all my days.<br/>For no-one else in history is like You,<br/>And history itself belongs to You.<br/>Alpha and Omega, You have loved me,<br/>And I will share eternity with You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>It's all about you, Jesus,<br/>And all this is for You,<br/>For Your glory and Your fame.<br/>It's not about me,<br/>As if You should do things my way;<br/>You alone are God, and I surrender<br/>To Your ways.</lines>
    </verse>
