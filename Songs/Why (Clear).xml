  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Scorn the use of Jesus name, bid farewell to guilt and shame,<br/>You assault me with the lie, as I just stand idly by;<br/>I will scream for earthly things, but won't whisper for the King,<br/>You are right the Truth is dead, when I keep it in my head.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Why am I afraid of livin' out the Truth?<br/>When I am dying of my sin sweetened tooth;<br/>Though I fall I'll never fall away from You, so<br/>Why am I afraid of living out the Truth?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I forsake my Savior's might, as I push Him from my sight,<br/>All alone I choose to stay, hidden deep within my cave;<br/>Could I leave and face the storm with a faith that's so lukewarm?<br/>It's a fence too thin to ride, hot or cold I must decide.</lines>
    </verse>
