    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a great day coming, A great day coming, There's a great day coming by and by; When the saints and the sinners shall be parted right and left, Are you ready for that day to come? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready for the judgment day? Are you ready? Are you ready? For the judgment day?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There's a bright day coming, A bright day coming, There's a bright day coming by and by; But its brightness shall only come to them that love the Lord, Are you ready for that day to come? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready for the judgment day? Are you ready? Are you ready? For the judgment day?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's a sad day coming, A sad day coming, There's a sad day coming by and by; When the sinner shall hear his doom, "Depart, I know ye not," Are you ready for that day to come? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready for the judgment day? Are you ready? Are you ready? For the judgment day?</lines>
