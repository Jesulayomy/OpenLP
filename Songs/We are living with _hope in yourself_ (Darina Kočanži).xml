      <lines>We are living with "hope in yourself"<br/>We are living without faith and without love.<br/>But we cannot stop the time<br/>To extend the life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus is the hope to live again<br/>He taught us to believe and love<br/>For us, He left the world of Heaven<br/>He died and rose again</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Love did not die on the sinful Earth<br/>It resurrected on the third day<br/>And Love revived inside of me and inside of you<br/>Now this World warmed by it.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I dip into Him as in the sea<br/>I will put on white clothes<br/>And will spread my wings above the earth<br/>Jesus, be with me !</lines>
