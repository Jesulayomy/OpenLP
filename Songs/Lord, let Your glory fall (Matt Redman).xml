    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, let Your glory fall as on that ancient day.<br/>Songs of enduring love, and then Your glory came.<br/>And as a sign to You<br/>that we would love the same,<br/>Our hearts will sing that song; God, let Your glory come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.<br/>You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.<br/>You are good, You are good, and Your love endures today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Voices in unison<br/>giving You thanks and praise,<br/>Joined by the instruments and then Your glory came.<br/>Your presence like a cloud<br/>upon that ancient day.<br/>The priests were overwhelmed because Your glory came.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>A sacrifice was made, and then Your fire came.<br/>They knelt upon the ground,<br/>and with one voice they praised. (2x)</lines>
