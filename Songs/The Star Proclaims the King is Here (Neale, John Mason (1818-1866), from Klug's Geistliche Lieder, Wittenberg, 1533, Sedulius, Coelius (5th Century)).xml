    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The star proclaims the King is here; But, Herod, why this senseless fear? He takes no realms of earth away Who gives the realms of heav'nly day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The wiser Magi see from far And follow on His guiding star; And led by light, to light they press And by their gifts their God confess.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Within the Jordan's crystal flood In meekness stands the Lamb of God And, sinless, sanctifies the wave, Mankind from sin to cleanse and save.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>At Cana first His pow'r is shown; His might the blushing waters own And, changing as He speaks the word, Flow wine, obedient to their Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>All glory, Jesus, be to Thee For this Thy glad epiphany; Whom with the Father we adore And Holy Ghost forevermore.</lines>
