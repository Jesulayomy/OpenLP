    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>At all times I will bless Him<br/>His praise will be in my mouth<br/>My soul makes its boast in the Lord<br/>The humble man will hear of Him<br/>The afflicted will be glad<br/>And join with me to magnify the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Let us exalt His name together, forever<br/>I sought the Lord, He heard me<br/>And delivered me from my fears.<br/>Let us exalt His name together, forever<br/>0 sing His praises magnify the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The angel of the Lord encamps<br/>Round those who fear His Name<br/>To save them and deliver them from harm<br/>Though lions roar with hunger<br/>We lack for no good thing<br/>No wonder then we praise Him with our song</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Come children now and hear Him<br/>If you would see long life<br/>Just keep your mouth from wickedness and lies<br/>Do good and turn from evil<br/>Seek peace instead of strife<br/>Love righteousness and God will hear your cry</lines>
    </verse>
