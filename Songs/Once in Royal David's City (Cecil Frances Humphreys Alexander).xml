    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Once in royal David's city,<br/>stood a lowly cattle shed<br/>Where a mother laid her baby,<br/>in a manger for His bed<br/>Mary was that mother mild,<br/>Jesus Christ her little child</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He came down to earth from heaven,<br/>who is God and Lord of all<br/>And His shelter was a stable,<br/>and His cradle was a stall<br/>With the poor and mean and lowly,<br/>lived on earth our Saviour holy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And through all His wondrous childhood,<br/>He would honour and obey<br/>Love and watch the lowly mother,<br/>in whose gentle arms He lay<br/>Christian children all should be,<br/>kind, obedient, good as He</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For He is our childhood's pattern,<br/>day by day like us He grew<br/>He was little, weak and helpless,<br/>tears and smiles like us He knew<br/>And He feels for all our sadness,<br/>and He shares in all our gladness</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>And our eyes at last shall see Him,<br/>through His own redeeming love<br/>For that Child so dear and gentle,<br/>is our Lord in heaven above<br/>And He leads His children on,<br/>to the place where He is gone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Not in that poor lowly stable,<br/>with the oxen standing by<br/>We shall see Him but in heaven,<br/>set at God's right hand on high<br/>There His children gather round,<br/>bright like stars, with glory crowned</lines>
    </verse>
