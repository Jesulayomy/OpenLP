    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O Father, all creating, Whose wisdom, love, and pow'r First bound two lives together In Eden's primal hour, Today to these Thy children Thy earliest gifts renew: A home by Thee made happy, A love by Thee kept true.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O Savior, Guest most bounteous Of old in Galilee, Vouchsafe today Thy presence With these who call on Thee; Their store of earthly gladness Transform to heav'nly wine, And teach them, in the tasting To know the gift is Thine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O Spirit of the Father, Breathe on them from above, So mighty in Thy pureness, So tender in Thy love; That, guarded by Thy presence, From sin and strife kept free, Their lives may own Thy guidance, Their hearts be rul'd by Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Except Thou build it, Father, The house is built in vain; Except Thou, Savior, bless it, The joy will turn to pain; But naught can break the union Of hearts in Thee made one, And love Thy Spirit hallow'd Is endless love begun.</lines>
