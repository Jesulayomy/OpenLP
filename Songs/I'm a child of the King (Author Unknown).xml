    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Once I was clothed in the rags of my sin<br/>Wretched and poor lost and lonely within<br/>But with wonderous compassion the King of all Kings<br/>In pity and love took me under his wing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh yes, oh yes, I'm a child of the King<br/>His royal blood now flows in my veins<br/>And I who was wretched and poor now can sing<br/>Praise God Praise God I'm a child of the King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now I'm a child with a heavenly home<br/>My holy father has made me his own<br/>And I am cleansed by his blood and I'm clothed in his love<br/>And someday I'll sing with the angels above.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Oh yes, oh yes, I'm a child of the King<br/>His royal blood now flows in my veins<br/>And I who was wretched and poor now can sing<br/>Praise God Praise God I'm a child of the King!</lines>
