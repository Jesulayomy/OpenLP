    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God, whose almighty word Chaos and darkness heard And took their flight: Hear us, we humble pray, And where the Gospel day Sheds not its glorious ray, Let there be light!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord, who once came to bring, On your redeeming wing, Healing and sight, Health to the sick in mind, Sight to the inly blind: Oh, now to humankind Let there be light!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Spirit of truth and love, Life giving, holy dove, Speed forth your flight; Move on the water's face, Bearing the lamp of grace, And in earth's darkest place Let there be light!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Holy and blessed three, Glorious Trinity, Wisdom, love, might! Boundless as ocean's tide, Rolling in fullest pride, Through the earth, far and wide, Let there be light!</lines>
    </verse>
