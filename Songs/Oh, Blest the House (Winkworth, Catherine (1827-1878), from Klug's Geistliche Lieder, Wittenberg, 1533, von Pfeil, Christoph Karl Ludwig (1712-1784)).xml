    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh blest the house, whate'er befall, Where Jesus Christ is All in All; Yea, if He were not dwelling there, How poor and dark and void it were!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh blest that house where faith ye find, And all within have set their mind To trust their God and serve Him still, And do in all His holy will.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Blest, where their prayers shall daily rise As fragrant incense to the skies, While in their lives the world is taught That forms without the heart are naught.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Blest, where the busy hands fulfil Their proper task with ready skill, While through their different works ye see One spirit run of unity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Blest such a house, it prospers well, In peace and joy the parents dwell, And in their children's lot is shown How richly God can bless His own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Then here will I and mine to-day<br/>A solemn covenant make, and say,--<br/>Though all the world forsake Thy Word,<br/>I and my house will serve the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
