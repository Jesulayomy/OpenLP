    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The chimes of time ring out the news,<br/>another day is through.<br/>Someone slipped and fell,<br/>was that someone you?<br/>You may have longed for added strength,<br/>your courage to renew.<br/>Do not be disheartened,<br/>for I have news for you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>It is no secret<br/>what God can do,<br/>What He's done for others<br/>He'll do for you.<br/>With arms wide open,<br/>He'll pardon you.<br/>It is no secret<br/>what God can do</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There is no night, for in His light,<br/>You'll never walk alone.<br/>Always feel at home,<br/>where ever you may roam.<br/>There is no power can conquer you,<br/>while God is on your side.<br/>Just take Him at His Promise,<br/>Don't run away and hide.</lines>
