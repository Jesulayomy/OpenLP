    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Go to dark Gethsemane, ye that feel the tempter's pow'r; Your Redeemer's conflict see, watch with Him one bitter hour, Turn not from His griefs away; learn from Jesus Christ to pray.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Follow to the judgment hall, view the Lord of Life arraigned; O the wormwood and the gall! O the pangs His soul sustained! Shun not suff'ring, shame, or loss; learn from Christ to bear the cross.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Calv'ry's mournful mountain climb; there, adoring at His feet, Mark that miracle of time, God's own sacrifice complete. "It is finished!" hear Him cry; learn from Jesus Christ to die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Early hasten to the tomb where they laid His breathless clay; All is solitude and gloom. Who has taken Him away? Christ is ris'n! He meets our eyes; Savior, teach us so to rise.</lines>
