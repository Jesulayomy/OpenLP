    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O love, how deep, how broad, how high, How passing thought and fantasy, That God, the Son of God, should take Our mortal form for mortals' sake!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He sent no angel to our race Of higher or of lower place, But wore the robe of human frame And He Himself, to this world came.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Nor willed He only to appear; His pleasure was to tarry here; And God and Man with man would be The space of thirty years and three.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For us baptized, for us He bore His holy fast and hungered sore, For us temptations sharp He knew; For us the tempter overthrew.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>For us He prayed; for us He taught; For us His daily works He wrought; By words and signs and actions thus Still seeking not Himself, but us.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>For us to wicked men betrayed,<br/>Scourged, mocked, in crown of thorns arrayed,<br/>For us He bore the cross's death,<br/>For us at length gave up His breath.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>For us He rose from death again;<br/>For us He went on high to reign;<br/>For us He sent His Spirit here,<br/>To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>All honor, laud, and glory be,<br/>O Jesus, virgin-born to Thee!<br/>All glory, as is ever meet<br/>To Father and to Paraclete.</lines>
    </verse>
