    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who is moving on the waters? Who is holding up the moon?<br/>Who is peeling back the darkness, with the burning light of noon?<br/>Who is standing on the mountains? Who is on the earth below?<br/>Who is bigger than the heavens, and the Lover of my soul?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who is He that makes me happy? Who is He that gives me peace?<br/>Who is He that brings me comfort,  and turns the bitter into sweet?<br/>Who is stirring up my passion?  Who is rising up in me?<br/>Who is filling up my hunger,  with everything I need?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Creator God, He is Yahweh, The Great I Am, He is Yahweh,<br/>The Lord of All, He is Yahweh;<br/>Rose of Sharon, He is Yahweh, The Righteous Son, He is Yahweh,<br/>The Three-in-one, He is Yahweh.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>You are holy and eternal, and forever You will reign;<br/>Every knee will bow before You, every tongue will confess Your name;<br/>All the angels give You glory, as they stand before Your throne,<br/>And here on earth we gather, to declare Your name alone.</lines>
    </verse>
