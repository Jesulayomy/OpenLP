    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I see the city lights all around me<br/>Everyone's obscure<br/>Ten million people each with their problems<br/>Why should anyone care</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>And in Your eyes I can see</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world<br/>Lost in a Sea of Faces<br/>Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine<br/>Because you traded Your life for mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sometimes my life it feels so trivial<br/>Immersed in the greatness of space<br/>Yet somehow you still find the time for me<br/>It's then You show me Your love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p2">
      <lines>And In Your eyes I can see<br/>And in Your arms I will be</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world<br/>Lost in a Sea of Faces<br/>Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine<br/>Because you traded Your life for mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>If only my one heart<br/>Was all you'd gain from all it cost<br/>Well I know you would have still been a man<br/>With a reason to willingly offer your life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world<br/>Lost in a Sea of Faces<br/>Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine<br/>Because you traded Your life for mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>End:<br/>Just one in a million faces</lines>
