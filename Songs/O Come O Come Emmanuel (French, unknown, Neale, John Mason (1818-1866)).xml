  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O come, O come, Emmanuel, And ransom captive Israel, That mourns in lonely exile here Until the Son of God appear. Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O come, Thou Wisdom from on high, Who orderest all things mightily; To us the path of knowledge show, And teach us in her ways to go. Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free Thine own from Satan's tyranny; From depths of hell Thy people save, And give them vict'ry ov'r the grave. Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer Our spirits by Thine advent here; Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, And death's dark shadows put to flight. Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>O come, Thou Key of David, come, And open wide our heav'nly home; Make safe the way that leads on high, And close the path to misery. Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.</lines>
