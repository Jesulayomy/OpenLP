    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is no problem so big, God cannot solve it<br/>There is no mountain so tall, He cannot move it<br/>There is no storm so dark, God cannot calm it<br/>There is no sorrow so deep, God cannot soothe it</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>If He carried the weight of the world<br/>Upon His shoulders<br/>I know my brother, that He will carry you<br/>If He carried the weight of the world<br/>Upon His shoulders<br/>I know, my sister, that He will carry you</lines>
