    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I come on my knees<br/>To lay down before you,<br/>Bringing all that I am,<br/>Longing only to know you.<br/>Seeking your face,<br/>And not only your hand,<br/>I find you embracing me<br/>Just as I am.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>And I lift these songs to you and you alone.<br/>As I sing to you, in my praises make your home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>To my audience of one,<br/>You are Father, and You are Son.<br/>As Your Spirit flows free,<br/>Let it find within me<br/>A heart that beats to praise you.<br/>And now just to know you more<br/>Has become my great reward,<br/>To see Your kingdom come<br/>And Your will be done.<br/>I only desire to be Yours, Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So what could I bring<br/>To honor your majesty?<br/>What song could I sing<br/>That would move the heart of royalty?<br/>And all that I have<br/>Is the life that You've given me.<br/>So Lord let me live for You,<br/>This song with humility.</lines>
