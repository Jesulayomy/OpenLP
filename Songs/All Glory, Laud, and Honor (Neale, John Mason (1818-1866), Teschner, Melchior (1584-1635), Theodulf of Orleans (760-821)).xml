    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All glory, laud and honor, To Thee, Redeemer, King, To Whom the lips of children Made sweet hosannas ring. Thou art the King of Israel, Thou David's royal Son, Who in the Lord's Name comest, The King and Blessed One.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All glory, laud and honor, To Thee, Redeemer, King, To Whom the lips of children Made sweet hosannas ring. The company of angels Are praising Thee on High, And mortal men and all things Created make reply.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>All glory, laud and honor, To Thee, Redeemer, King, To Whom the lips of children Made sweet hosannas ring. The people of the Hebrews With palms before Thee went; Our prayer and praise and anthems Before Thee we present.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>All glory, laud and honor, To Thee, Redeemer, King, To Whom the lips of children Made sweet hosannas ring. To Thee, before Thy passion, They sang their hymns of praise; To Thee, now high exalted, Our melody we raise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>All glory, laud and honor, To Thee, Redeemer, King, To Whom the lips of children Made sweet hosannas ring. Thou didst accept their praises; Accept the prayers we bring, Who in all good delightest, Thou good and gracious King.</lines>
