      <lines>Verse: 3 (Tedashii)<br/>Yea, uh, uh, uh<br/>On the banks of the river looking for chances to get up<br/>Stir up the pool and bring healing to bones that's feeling brittle<br/>I've been beat up in the streets, but I believe something's coming<br/>There's no way I can move unless You choose to do something<br/>This life, this life is so heavy; lost my son, he in heaven<br/>I was chasing this leaven<br/>Hanging with dudes that is deadly, but this life is now over<br/>Moreover I'm ready go on<br/>I'm ready to change it all<br/>Lord, just help me I'm all in<br/>On the banks of the river<br/>Looking out for the promised land<br/>Tell Him I need Him now, I don't have any other plans<br/>Sweet Lord, I know I need You<br/>There's relief from the grief when I see You</lines>
