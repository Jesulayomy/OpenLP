    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I keep fighting voices<br/>in my mind that say I'm not enough<br/>Every single lie that tells me<br/>I will never measure up<br/>Am I more than just the sum<br/>of every high and every low?<br/>Remind me once again just who I am,<br/>because I need to know (ooh oh)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing<br/>You say I am strong when I think I am weak<br/>You say I am held when I am falling short<br/>When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours<br/>And I believe (I), oh I believe (I)<br/>What You say of me (I)<br/>I believe</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The only thing that matters now<br/>is everything You think of me<br/>In You I find my worth,<br/>in You I find my identity, (ooh oh)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing<br/>You say I am strong when I think I am weak<br/>You say I am held when I am falling short<br/>When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours<br/>And I believe (I), oh I believe (I)<br/>What You say of me (I)<br/>I believe</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Taking all I have and now<br/>I'm laying it at Your feet<br/>You have every failure God,<br/>and You'll have every victory, (ooh oh)</lines>
