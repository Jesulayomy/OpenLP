    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The people that in darkness sat A glorious light have seen; The light has shined on them who long In shades of death have been. In shades of death have been.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To hail Thee, Sun of Righteousness, The gath'ring nations come; They joy as when the reapers bear Their harvest treasures home. Their harvest treasures home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For Thou their burden dost remove And break the tyrant's rod As in the day when Midian fell Before the sword of God. Before the sword of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>To us a Child of hope is born, To us a Son is giv'n, And on His shoulder ever rests All pow'r in earth and heav'n. All pow'r in earth and heav'n.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>His name shall be the Prince of Peace, The Everlasting Lord, The Wonderful, the Counselor. The God by all adored. The God by all adored.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>His righteous government and power<br/>Shall over all extend;<br/>On judgment and on justice based,<br/>His reign shall have no end.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Lord Jesus, reign in us, we pray,<br/>And make us Thine alone,<br/>Who with the Father ever art<br/>And Holy Spirit, one.</lines>
