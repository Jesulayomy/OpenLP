      <lines>Intro:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse: 1<br/>I can hear the footsteps of my King<br/>I can hear his heartbeat beckoning<br/>In my darkness, He has set me free<br/>Now I hear the spirit calling me, He's calling</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Wake up child, It's our turn to shine<br/>We were born for such a time as this<br/>Wake up child, It's our turn to shine<br/>We were born for such a time as this</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Verse: 2<br/>I can hear a holy rumbling<br/>I've begun to preach another King<br/>Loosing chains and breaking down the walls<br/>I want to hear the Father when he calls, He's calling</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge: 1<br/>This is the anthem of our generation,<br/>Here we are God, shake our nation<br/>All we need is your love<br/>You captivate us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b2">
      <lines>Bridge: 2<br/>We are royalty<br/>We have destiny<br/>We have been set free<br/>We're gonna shake history</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We're gonna change the world!</lines>
