      <lines>When darkness rises all around us<br/>We will see His glory breaking through the night<br/>The King in all His wonder fills us with His power<br/>Christ in us, the answer, A hope for all the world</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Our God is strong in us<br/>His love has overcome<br/>He is alive in us, He is the Risen One<br/>The same power that raised Him up<br/>Is the power that lives in us<br/>Our God is strong in us, Our God is strong in us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His promise stands throughout the ages<br/>He will never leave us, We are not alone<br/>Greater than our weakness, He is strong to save us<br/>We will stand victorious, A hope for all the world</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lift Him up, let the whole world see<br/>We will never stop singing<br/>Lift Him up, let the whole world hear<br/>We will never stop shouting<br/>Lift Him up, every voice in praise<br/>Everyone lift Him up</lines>
