    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I set out on a narrow way many years ago<br/>Hoping I would find true love along the broken road<br/>But I got lost a time or two<br/>Wiped my brow and kept pushing through<br/>I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>CHORUS<br/>Every long lost dream lead me to where you are<br/>Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars<br/>Pointing me on my way into your loving arms<br/>This much I know (I know) is true<br/>That God blessed the broken road<br/>That led me straight to you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>VERSE2<br/>I think about the years I spent just passing through<br/>I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you<br/>But you just smile and take my hand<br/>You've been there you understand<br/>It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
