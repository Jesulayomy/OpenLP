    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Magnificent, Holy Father, I stand in awe of all I see.<br/>Of all the things You have created, and still You choose to think of me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And who am I that You should suffer Your very life to set me free?<br/>The only thing that I can give You  is the life You gave to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>This is my offering, dear Lord. This is my offering to You, God.<br/>I will give You my life, for it's all I have to give,<br/>Because You gave Your life for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I stand before You at this altar; so many have given You more.<br/>I may not have much I can offer, yet what I have is truly Yours.</lines>
    </verse>
