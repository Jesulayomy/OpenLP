    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I Have Lost My Reputation Since I Turned My<br/>Back On Sin,<br/>And A Lot Of Friends Went From Me Since I<br/>Let My Saviour In;<br/>Now They Pass Me By Unknown, When They<br/>Once Passed With A Smile;<br/>Now They Say I'm Very Foolish, And They Say<br/>I'm Out Of Style.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I Am Marked, Marked, Marked,<br/>I Am Marked, Now Wherever I Go;<br/>I Am Marked, Marked, Marked,<br/>Just What I Am Everyone Seems To Know.<br/>I Am Sealed, Sealed, Sealed,<br/>I Am Sealed By His Spirit Divine;<br/>O Glory To God! Hallelujah! Amen!<br/>I Am His And I Know That He Is Mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Well, They Say My Life Is Ruined, And My<br/>Talent Thrown Away,<br/>And They Cannot Understand It, For I Had<br/>Such Plans One Day;<br/>But I Know What I Surrendered When I<br/>Promised I'd Go Through;<br/>And I Gained Far More Glory Since God<br/>Made Me Over New.</lines>
