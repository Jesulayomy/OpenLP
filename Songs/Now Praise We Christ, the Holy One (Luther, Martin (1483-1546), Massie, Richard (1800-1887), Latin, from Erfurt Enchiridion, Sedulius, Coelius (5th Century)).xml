    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Now praise we Christ, the Holy One, The spotless virgin Mary's Son, Far as the bless√©d sun doth shine E'en to the world's remote confine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He, who Himself all things did make, A servant's form vouchsafed to take, That He as man mankind might win, And save His creatures from their sin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The grace of God, th'Almighty Lord, On the chaste mother was outpoured a virgin pure and undefiled In wondrous wise conceived a child.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The holy maid became th'abode And temple of the living God; And she, who knew not man, was blest With God's own Word made manifest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>The noble mother bare a Son, For so did Gabriel's promise run, Whom John confessed and leapt with joy, Ere yet the mother knew her boy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>In a rude manger, stretched on hay, In poverty content He lay;<br/>With milk was fed the Lord of all, Who feeds the ravens when they call.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Th' angelic choir rejoice, and raise Their voice to God in songs of praise;<br/>To humble shepherds is proclaimed The Shepherd who the world hath framed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>Honor to Thee, O Christ, be paid, Pure offspring of a holy maid,<br/>With Father and with Holy Ghost, Till time in time's abyss be lost.</lines>
    </verse>
