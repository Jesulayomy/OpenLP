    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I love the way, I love the way you carry on.<br/>You make me wanna say, You make me wanna sing another love song.<br/>Sing another love song, Sing another love song,<br/>Sing another love song to you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Bury my head for the shame,<br/>you pick me up, you say I look like you.<br/>Though it makes no sense to me,<br/>You make me believe that I could trust someone.<br/>I could ever trust someone,<br/>I could ever trust someone,<br/>I could ever trust someone,<br/>I could ever trust someone.</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Sing another love song. Sing another love song.<br/>Sing another love song. Sing another love song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I walk through flame, I touch the fire,<br/>You know that I still burn for You.<br/>Flood water, rain crash down, soak the ground,<br/>Still I thirst for you. Still I thirst for you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Sing another love song. Sing another love song.<br/>Though it makes no sense to me, You make me wanna sing,<br/>Make me wanna sing...</lines>
