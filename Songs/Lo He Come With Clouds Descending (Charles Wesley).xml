    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lo, He comes with coulds descending,<br/>Once for favoured sinners slain;<br/>Thousand thousand saints attending<br/>Swell the triumph of His train:<br/>Alleluia!<br/>Alleluia!<br/>Alleluia!<br/>God appears on earth to reign.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Every eye shall now behold Him<br/>Robed in glorious majesty;<br/>Those who set at naught and sold Him,<br/>Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,<br/>Deeply wailing,<br/>Deeply wailing,<br/>Deeply wailing,<br/>Shall their true Messiah see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Those dear tokens of His passion<br/>Still His dazzling body bears;<br/>Cause of endless exultation<br/>To His ransomed worshippers:<br/>With what rapture,<br/>With what rapture,<br/>With what rapture,<br/>Gaze we on those glorious scars.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Yea, Amen, let all adore Thee,<br/>High on Thine eternal throne;<br/>Saviour, take the power and glory,<br/>Claim the kingdom for Thine own:<br/>Come, Lord Jesus!<br/>Come, Lord Jesus!<br/>Come, Lord Jesus!<br/>Everlasting God, come down!</lines>
