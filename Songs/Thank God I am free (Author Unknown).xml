    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Thank God I am free, free, free<br/>From this world of sin.<br/>I've been washed in the blood of Jesus,<br/>I've been born again.<br/>Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, saved<br/>By His wonderful grace.<br/>I'm so glad that I found out<br/>He could bring me out<br/>And show me the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For a long time I travelled<br/>Down a long lonely road;<br/>My heart was so heavy in sin I sank low.<br/>Then I heard about Jesus,<br/>What a wonderful hour;<br/>I'm so glad that I found out<br/>He could bring me out<br/>Through His saving power.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Thank God I am free, free, free<br/>From this world of sin.<br/>I've been washed in the blood of Jesus,<br/>I've been born again.<br/>Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, saved<br/>By His wonderful grace.<br/>I'm so glad that I found out<br/>He could bring me out<br/>And show me the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Like a bird out of prison<br/>That has taken its flight;<br/>Like a blind man that God<br/>Gave back his sight.<br/>Like a poor wretched beggar<br/>That's found fortune and fame,<br/>I'm so glad that I found out<br/>He could bring me out<br/>Thro' His holy name.</lines>
