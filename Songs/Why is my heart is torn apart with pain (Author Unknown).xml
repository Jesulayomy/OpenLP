    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Why is my heart is torn apart with pain<br/>And the sorrow doesn't let me see the light?<br/>Why does the fire of hate burn?<br/>Who can give me the answer?<br/>Still I know that the Lord is Great<br/>And according to His promise<br/>He wil give me the strengths for my earth walk<br/>And I will remain in His love.<br/>But that Day will answer all the questions of life,<br/>That Day will reveal us all reasons of sufferings.<br/>That Day will break through the sorrow,<br/>That Day will shine more than sun,<br/>In that Day I will see my Lord.</lines>
