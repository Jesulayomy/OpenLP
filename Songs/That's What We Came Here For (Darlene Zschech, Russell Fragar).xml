    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We come into Your presence with singing,<br/>Come into Your presence with praise<br/>And enter Your gates with thankful hearts,<br/>We are going to celebrate; All of Heavens waiting<br/>Power is on its way; So we shout Hallelujah<br/>Lifting to You a mighty roar of praise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>You de*serve the highest praise, That we can give and more<br/>Lord we give You our praise; That's what we came here for<br/>You de*serve the highest praise, That we can give and more<br/>Lord we give You our praise; That's what we came here for</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Everything within me; Reaches out to You<br/>Your power, Your majesty; Grace and mercy too<br/>There'll be singing and dancing; Hearts and voices raised<br/>You have set you people free; Now the house if filled with praise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b2">
      <lines>You deserve the Highest Praise</lines>
