    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>What is this love that won't relent<br/>That's calling out with heaven's breath<br/>Who's reaching wide to save our souls<br/>Only You<br/>What is this grace that makes no sense<br/>That we could never recompense<br/>Who gives us all a second chance<br/>Only You, Only You, Only You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>There is no one like our God<br/>There is no one like our God<br/>There is no other God who can save<br/>There is no one like our God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who hung the stars upon the night<br/>And showed the sun how bright to shine<br/>Who shaped with world within His hands<br/>Only you<br/>Who set the sky upon the hills<br/>And told the waters to be still<br/>Who spoke to form the universe<br/>Only You, Only You, Only You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>No height or depth can stand between us<br/>No power on earth or all creation<br/>No life or death can separate us from Your love</lines>
    </verse>
