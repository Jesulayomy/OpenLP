    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Why should we tarry<br/>When Jesus is pleading,<br/>Pleading for you and for me?<br/>Why should we linger<br/>And heed not His mercies,<br/>Mercies for you and for me?</lines>

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh! for the wonderful love<br/>He has promised,<br/>Promised for you and for me;<br/>Though we have sinned,<br/>He has mercy and pardon,<br/>Pardon for you and for me.</lines>
