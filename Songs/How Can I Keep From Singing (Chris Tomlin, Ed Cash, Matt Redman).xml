    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is an endless song,<br/>Echoes in my soul;<br/>I hear the music ring.<br/>And though the storms may come,<br/>I am holding on;<br/>To the Rock I cling.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>How can I keep from singing Your praise?<br/>How can I ever say enough?<br/>How amazing is Your Love!<br/>How can I keep from shouting Your Name?<br/>I know I am loved by the King<br/>And it makes my heart want to sing!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I will lift my eyes<br/>In the darkest night,<br/>For I know my Savior lives.<br/>And I will walk with You,<br/>Knowing You'll see me through,<br/>And sing the songs You give.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I can sing in the troubled times,<br/>Sing when I win.<br/>I can sing when I lose my step<br/>And fall down again.<br/>I can sing, 'cause You pick me up,<br/>Sing, 'cause You're there.<br/>I can sing, 'cause You hear me, Lord,<br/>When I call to You in prayer.<br/>I can sing with my last breath,<br/>Sing, for I know<br/>That I'll sing with the angels<br/>And the saints around the throne!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>How can I keep from singing Your praise?<br/>How can I ever say enough?<br/>How amazing is Your Love!<br/>How can I keep from shouting Your Name?<br/>I know I am loved by the King,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b2">
      <lines>And it makes my heart...<br/>I am loved by the King,<br/>And it makes my heart...<br/>I am loved by the King,<br/>And it makes my heart want to sing!<br/>Yeah, I can sing!</lines>
