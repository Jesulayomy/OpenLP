    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse 1<br/>I've tasted shame, I know regret,<br/>still get it wrong, even at my best,<br/>some days I stand, an inch from the edge,<br/>no way across, so lost.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus 1<br/>And loved, by the One who's seen the corners of my soul,<br/>I'm loved, by the One who reaches out and calls me home,<br/>so loved, by the One who chose to give up His life,<br/>I may never know how deep and how wide,<br/>I'm loved,<br/>I'm loved, oh.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Verse 2<br/>In spite of fear, it never ends,<br/>and hope can grow, no matter where I've been,<br/>I'm finding joy, in the middle of my pain,<br/>surprising truth, that cannot be contained.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Chorus 2<br/>I'm loved, by the One who's seen the corners of my soul,<br/>I'm loved, by the One who reaches out and calls me home,<br/>so loved, by the One who chose to give up His life,<br/>I may never know how deep and how wide, I'm loved.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Bridge<br/>(I'm), nothing, nothing, nothing can separate us,<br/>from His love, from His love,<br/>nothing, nothing, nothing can separate us,<br/>from His love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Chorus 3<br/>I'm loved, by the One who's seen the corners of my soul,<br/>I'm loved, by the One who reaches out and calls me home,<br/>so loved, by the One who chose to give up His life,<br/>I may never know how deep and how wide<br/>I'm loved, by the One who's seen the corners of my soul,<br/>Yes I'm loved, by the One who reaches out and calls me home,<br/>so loved, by the One who chose to give up His life,<br/>I may never know how deep and how wide,<br/>I may never know how deep and how wide, I'm loved.<br/>OUTRO: Hm | D | G</lines>
