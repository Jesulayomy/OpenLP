      <lines>I walk I walk, here and there<br/>I search I search, everywhere<br/>I turn around, here and there but<br/>There's no one, there's no one like Him.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You came to earth, a world to save<br/>Was crucified then rose again<br/>You've taken all my sin and shame<br/>There's no one, there's no none like Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And one day soon, you'll come again<br/>And take us home to be with Him<br/>And we will all forever sing<br/>There's no one, there's no one like Him.</lines>
