    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's hard to take the first step<br/>When I don't know the way<br/>Each turn is so uncertain<br/>I learn to walk by faith<br/>But you gave me a promise<br/>That you would never leave<br/>You will lead and guide me<br/>Lord, I do believe</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>CHORUS<br/>Lead me Lord, I will follow<br/>Lead me Lord, I will go<br/>You have called me<br/>I will answer<br/>Lead me Lord, I will go</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Your plans for me are perfect<br/>I never need to fear<br/>For though in times I feel alone<br/>I know that You are near<br/>My heart just wants to follow<br/>I'm willing to obey<br/>Take my hand and lead me<br/>I'll follow all the way!</lines>
