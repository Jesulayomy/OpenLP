    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As safe a stronghold our God is still,<br/>A trusty shield and weapon;<br/>He’ll help us clear from all the ill<br/>That hath us now o’ertaken.<br/>The ancient prince of hell<br/>Hath risen with purpose fell;<br/>Strong mail of craft and power<br/>He weareth in this hour;<br/>On earth is not His fellow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>With force of arms we nothing can,<br/>Full soon were we down-ridden;<br/>But for us fights the proper Man,<br/>Whom God Himself hath bidden.<br/>Ask ye: Who is this same?<br/>Christ Jesus is His name,<br/>The Lord Sabaoth’s Son;<br/>He, and no other one,<br/>Shall conquer in the battle.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And were this world all devils o’er,<br/>And watching to devour us,<br/>We lay it not to heart so sore;<br/>Not they can overpower us.<br/>And let the prince of ill<br/>Look grim as e’er he will,<br/>He harms us not a whit;<br/>For why? his doom is writ;<br/>A word shall quickly slay him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>God’s word, for all their craft and force,<br/>One moment will not linger,<br/>But, spite of hell, shall have its course;<br/>’Tis written by His finger.<br/>And though they take our life,<br/>Goods, honour, children, wife,<br/>Yet is their profit small:<br/>These things shall vanish all;<br/>The city of God remaineth.</lines>
