    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My faith has found a resting place, <br/>Not in a man made creed, <br/>I trust the Ever-living one, <br/>That he died for me will plead</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I need no other evidence, <br/>I need no other plea, <br/>It is enough that Jesus died, <br/>And rose again for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Enough for me that Jesus saves, <br/>This ends my fear and doubt; <br/>A sinful soul I come to Him, <br/>He will not cast me out.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>My great Physician heals the sick,<br/>The lost He came to save; <br/>For me His precious blood He shed, <br/>For me His life He gave</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>My soul is resting on the Word, <br/>The living Word of God, <br/>Salvation in my saviors name, <br/>Salvation through His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
