    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come and see, come and see,<br/>Come and see the King of Love;<br/>See the purple robe and crown of thorns He wears.<br/>Soldiers mock, rulers sneer,<br/>As He lifts the cruel cross;<br/>Lone and friendless now He climbs towards the hill.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>We worship at your feet,<br/>Where wrat and mercy meet,<br/>And a guilty world is washed by love's pure stream.<br/>For us He was made sin,<br/>Oh help me take it in<br/>Deep wounds of love cry out 'Father, forgive!'<br/>I worship, I worship, The Lamb who was slain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Come and weep, come and mourn,<br/>For your sin that pierced Him there;<br/>So much deeper than the wounds of thorn and nail.<br/>All our pride, all our greed,<br/>All our fallenness and shame;<br/>And the Lord has laid the punishment on Him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Man of Heaven, born to Earth<br/>To restore us to Your Heaven,<br/>Here we bow in awe beneath Your searching eyes.<br/>From Your tears comes our joy,<br/>From your death our life shall spring,<br/>By Your ressurrection power we shall rise!</lines>
    </verse>
