    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We will give ourselves no rest<br/>'Till Your kingdom comes on earth;<br/>You've positioned watchmen on the walls.<br/>Now our prayers will flow like tears,<br/>For You've shared your heart with us;<br/>God of heaven, on our knees we fall.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>Come down in power, reveal Your heart again;<br/>Come hear our cries, the tears that plead for rain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>We're knocking, knocking on the door of heaven,<br/>We're crying, crying for this generation,<br/>We're praying for Your name to be known in all of the earth.<br/>We're watching, watching on the walls to see You,<br/>We're looking, looking for a time of breakthrough,<br/>We're praying for Your word to bear fruit<br/>In all of the earth, in all of the earth.</lines>
