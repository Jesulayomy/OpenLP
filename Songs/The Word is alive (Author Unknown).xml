    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Word is alive</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Looking out from His throne, the Father of light and of men<br/>Chose to make Himself known and show us the way back to Him<br/>Speaking wisdom and truth into the hearts of peasants and kings<br/>He began to unveil the Word that would change the course of all things</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>With eyes wide open, all would see</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>The Word is alive and it cuts like a sword through the darkness<br/>With a message of life to the hopeless and afraid<br/>Breathing life into all who believe<br/>The Word is alive and the world and its glories will fade<br/>But His truth, it will not pass away<br/>It remains yesterday and forever the same<br/>The Word is alive</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Simple strokes on a page eternity's secrets revealed,<br/>Carried on from age to age it speaks Truth to us even still<br/>And as the rain falls from Heaven, feeds the earth before it returns<br/>Lord, let Your Word fall on us and bring forth the fruit You deserve</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>With eyes wide open, let us see</lines>
    </verse>
