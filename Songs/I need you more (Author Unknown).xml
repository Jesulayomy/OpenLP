      <lines>I need You more, more than yesterday<br/>I need You Lord, more than words can say<br/>I need You more, than ever before<br/>I need You Lord<br/>I need You Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>More than the air I breathe<br/>More than the song I sing<br/>More than the next heartbeat<br/>More than anything<br/>And Lord, as time goes by, I will be by your side<br/>Cause I never want to go back to my old life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>More than the air I breathe<br/>More than the song I sing<br/>More than the next heartbeat<br/>More than anything<br/>And Lord, as time goes by, I will be by your side<br/>Cause I never want to go back to my old life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Bridge<br/>Right here in Your presence is where I belong<br/>This old broken heart has finally found a home<br/>And I'll never be alone</lines>
