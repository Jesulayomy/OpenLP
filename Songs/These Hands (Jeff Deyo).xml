  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The sun and moon and every star are there to show me who You are.<br/>I can be sure Your fingerprints are everywhere.<br/>My every move, my every breath, were meant to point to Your greatness.<br/>There's nothing made that was not made to show Your power.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>These hands were made to praise You.<br/>These lips were made to lift You up.<br/>I give to You my life in worship.<br/>These feet were made to serve You;<br/>This tongue, to sing of Your great love.<br/>I give to You my life in worship.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>A tender thought, a caring deed, a gift of love to one in need,<br/>Bringing honest acts of worship to You, Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Lifting holy hands in worship to You, Lord.<br/>God receive this humble sacrifice of praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b2">
      <lines>I give to You my life, my life to you in worship,<br/>In worship,<br/>In worship.<br/>My life, I give in worship.</lines>
