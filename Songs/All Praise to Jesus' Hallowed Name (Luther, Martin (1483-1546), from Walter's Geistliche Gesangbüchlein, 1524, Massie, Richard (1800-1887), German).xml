    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All praise to Jesus' hallowed Name Who of virgin pure became True man for us! The angels sing As the glad news to earth they bring. Hallelujah!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Th'Eternal Father's only Son For a manger leaves His throne Disguised in our poor flesh and blood See now the everlasting Good.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He whom the world could not inwrap Yonder lies in Mary's lap; He is become an infant small, Who by His might upholdeth all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Th'Eternal Light, come down from heav'n, Hath to us new sunshine giv'n; It shineth in the midst of night, And maketh us the sons of light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>The Father's Son, God ever\blest, In the world became a guest; He leads us from this vale of tears, And makes us in his kingdom heirs.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>He came to earth so mean and poor, Man to pity and restore,<br/>And make us rich in heaven above, Equal with angels through his love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>All this He did to show His grace To our poor and sinful race;<br/>For this let Christendom adore And praise His name for evermore.</lines>
