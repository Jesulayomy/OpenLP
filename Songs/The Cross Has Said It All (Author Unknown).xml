    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The cross has said it all,<br/>The cross has said it all.<br/>I can't deny what You have shown,<br/>The cross speaks of a God of love;<br/>there displayed for all to see,<br/>Jesus Christ, our only hope,<br/>a message of the Father's heart:<br/>"Come, my children, come on home."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>As high as the heavens are above the earth,<br/>so high is the measure of Your great love;<br/>as far as the east is from the west,<br/>so far have You taken our sins from us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The cross has said it all,<br/>the cross has said it all.<br/>I never recognized Your touch<br/>until I met You at the cross.<br/>We are fallen, dust to dust;<br/>how could You do this for us?<br/>son of God shed precious blood;<br/>who can comprehend this love?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>How high, how wide, how deep (x2)<br/>How high!</lines>
