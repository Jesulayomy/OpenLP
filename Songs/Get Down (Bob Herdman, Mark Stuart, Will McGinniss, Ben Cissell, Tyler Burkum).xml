  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lavishly our lives are wasted, humbleness is left untasted,<br/>You can't live your life to please yourself, yeah;<br/>That's a tip from my mistake, exactly what it doesn't take,<br/>To win you've got to come in last place.<br/>To live your life you've got to lose it, And all the losers get a crown.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I get down, and He lifts me up, I get down, and He lifts me up,<br/>I get down, and He lifts me up,<br/>I get down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All I need's another day where I can't seem to get away<br/>From the many things that drag me down, yeah;<br/>I'm sure you've had a day like me where nothing seems to set you free,<br/>From the burdens you can't carry all alone.<br/>In your weakness He is stronger, In your darkness He shines through;<br/>When you're crying He's your comfort, When you're all alone He's carrying you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>This valley  is so deep,  I can barely see the sun;<br/>I cry out  for mercy Lord,  And You lift me up again.</lines>
