    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Your only Son, no sin to hide; but You have sent Him from Your side,<br/>To walk upon this guilty sod and to become the Lamb of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Your Gift of Love they crucified; they laughed and scorned Him as He died;<br/>The humble King, they named a fraud<br/>and sacrificed the Lamb of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God;<br/>I love the holy Lamb of God;<br/>O wash me in His precious blood;<br/>My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I was so lost I should have died but You have brought me to Your side,<br/>To be led by Your staff and rod and to be called a lamb of God.</lines>
    </verse>
