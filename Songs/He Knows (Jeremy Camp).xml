    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse: 1<br/>All the bitter weary ways endless striving day by day<br/>You barely have the strength to pray in the valley low<br/>How hard your fight has been how deep the pain within<br/>Wounds that no one else has seen hurts too much to show</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Pre chorus:<br/>All the doubt you're standing in between<br/>And all the weight that brings you to your knees</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>He knows  He knows<br/>Every hurt and every sting He has walked the suffering<br/>He knows  He knows<br/>Let your burdens come undone lift your eyes up to the one</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse: 2<br/>We may faint and we may sink feel the pain and near the brink<br/>But the dark begins to shrink when you find the one who knows</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>Pre chorus:<br/>The chains of doubt that held you in between<br/>One by one are starting to break free</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>Every time that you feel forsaken<br/>Every time that you feel alone<br/>He is near to the broken hearted<br/>Every tear</lines>
    </verse>
