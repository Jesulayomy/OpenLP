    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I am a thief, I am a murderer<br/>Walking up this lonely hill.<br/>What have I done? I don't remember.<br/>No one knows just how I feel.<br/>And I know that my time is coming soon.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It's been so long. Oh, such a long time<br/>Since I've lived with peace and rest.<br/>Now I am here, at my destination.<br/>Guess things work for the best.<br/>And I know that my time is coming soon.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who is this man? This man beside me<br/>They call the King of the Jews.<br/>They don't believe that he's the Messiah,<br/>But somehow I know that it's true.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And they laugh at Him in mockery<br/>And beat him till He bleeds.<br/>They nail Him to the rugged cross,<br/>And raise Him, they raise him up next to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>My time has come. I'm slowly fading,<br/>But I deserve what I receive.<br/>Jesus, when you are in Your Kingdom<br/>Could You please remember me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>And He looks at me still holding on.<br/>The tears fall from His eyes.<br/>He says, "I tell the truth:<br/>Today, you will be with Me in paradise."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>And I know that my time is coming soon.<br/>And I know that my time is coming soon.<br/>And I know that paradise, paradise is coming soon.</lines>
    </verse>
