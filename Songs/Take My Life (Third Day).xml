    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How many times have I turned away?<br/>The number is the same as the sand on the shore.<br/>Every time, you've taken me back,<br/>And now I pray you do it once more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Please take from me my life,<br/>When I don't have the strength<br/>To give it away to you.<br/>Please take from me my life,<br/>When I don't have the strength<br/>To give it away to you, Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How many times have I gone astray?<br/>The number is the same as the stars in the sky.<br/>But every time you've taken me back,<br/>And now I pray you do it tonight.</lines>
