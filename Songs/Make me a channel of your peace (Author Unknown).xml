    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Make me a channel of your peace.<br/>Where there is hatred let me bring your love.<br/>Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord<br/>And where there's doubt, true faith in you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Make me a channel of your peace<br/>Where there's despair in life, let me bring hope<br/>Where there is darkness, only light<br/>And where there's sadness, ever joy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, Master grant that I may never seek<br/>So much to be consoled as to console<br/>To be understood as to understand<br/>To be loved as to love with all my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Make me a channel of your peace<br/>It is in pardoning that we are pardoned<br/>In giving to all men that we receive<br/>And in dying that we're born to eternal life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Oh, Master grant that I may never seek<br/>So much to be consoled as to console<br/>To be understood as to understand<br/>To be loved as to love with all my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Make me a channel of your peace<br/>It is in pardoning that we are pardoned<br/>In giving to all men that we receive<br/>And in dying that we're born to eternal life.</lines>
