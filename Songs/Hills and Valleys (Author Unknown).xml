    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've walked among the shadows<br/>You wiped my tears away<br/>And I've felt the pain of heartbreak<br/>And I've seen the brighter days<br/>And I've prayed prayers to heaven from my lowest place<br/>And I have held the blessings<br/>God, you give and take away</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>No matter what I have, Your grace is enough No matter where I am, I'm standing in Your love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>On the mountains, I will bow my life To the one who set me there<br/>In the valley, I will lift my eyes to the one who sees me there<br/>When I'm standing on the mountain aft, didn't get there on my own<br/>When I'm walking through the valley end, no I am not alone!<br/>You're God of the hills and valleys! Hills and Valleys! God of the hills and valleys<br/>And I am not alone!</lines>
    </verse>
