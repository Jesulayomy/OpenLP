    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Crown Him with many crowns,<br/>The Lamb upon His throne;<br/>Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns<br/>All music but its own!<br/>Awake, my soul, and sing<br/>Of Him who died for thee,<br/>And hail Him as thy matchless King<br/>Through all eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of life,<br/>Who triumphed oâ€™er the grave<br/>And rose victorious in the strife<br/>For those He came to save:<br/>His glories now we sing,<br/>Who died and rose on high,<br/>Who died eternal life to bring<br/>And lives that death may die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of love;<br/>Behold His hands and side,<br/>Those wounds yet visible above<br/>In beauty glorified:<br/>No angel in the sky<br/>Can fully bear that sight,<br/>But downward bends His burning eye<br/>At mysteries so bright.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of peace,<br/>Whose power a sceptre sways<br/>From pole to pole, that wars may cease,<br/>And all be prayer and praise:<br/>His reign shall know no end,<br/>And round His pierced feet<br/>Fair flowers of paradise extend<br/>Their fragrance ever sweet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of years,<br/>The Potentate of time,<br/>Creator of the rolling spheres,<br/>Ineffably sublime!<br/>All hail, Redeemer, hail!<br/>For Thou hast died for me;<br/>Thy praise shall never, never fail<br/>Throughout eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
