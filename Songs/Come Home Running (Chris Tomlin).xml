    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh heart of mine why must you stray?<br/>From One so fair you run away<br/>And one more time you have to pay<br/>The heaviness of needless shame<br/>Oh heart of mine come back home<br/>You've been too long out on your own<br/>And He's been there all along<br/>Watching for you down the road</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>So come home running<br/>His arms are open wide<br/>His name is Jesus and He understands<br/>He is the answer you are looking for<br/>So come home running just as you are</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh child of God so dearly loved<br/>And ransomed by the saviour's blood<br/>Called by name, daughter and son<br/>Wrapped in the robe of righteousness<br/>So come home running<br/>His arms are open wide<br/>His name is Jesus and He understands<br/>He is the answer you are looking for<br/>So come home running just as you are</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>So come home running<br/>His arms are open wide<br/>His name is Jesus and He understands<br/>He is the answer you are looking for<br/>So come home running just as you are<br/>Just as you are</lines>
