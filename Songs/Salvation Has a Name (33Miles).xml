    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I come to the altar, and I<br/>bow before you.<br/>You are everything my<br/>heart desires,<br/>A friend that is closer than any brother could be.<br/>I'm so amazed I can call out to you,<br/>And you hear me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Salvation has a Name.<br/>Mercy has a face.<br/>Holiness was crucified, rose to give us grace.<br/>Salvation has a Name.<br/>Mercy has a face.<br/>Jesus, our holiness,<br/>Worthy of all praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Every moment that I<br/>come to know you,<br/>I find a new depth<br/>of love surrounding me.<br/>Deeper than oceans, higher than any mountain peak.<br/>I'm so amazed at the wonder you hold,<br/>I can hardly believe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Jesus, Father, the Maker of time,<br/>Healer, Teacher, the Maker of light,<br/>You are sustainer to every life,<br/>God, our Saviour.</lines>

      <lines>Salvation has a Name.<br/>Mercy has a face.<br/>Holiness was crucified,<br/>And He rose.<br/>Jesus, our holiness,<br/>Worthy of all praise.<br/>Jesus, our holiness,<br/>Worthy of all praise.<br/>Salvation has a Name.<br/>Salvation has a Name.<br/>Salvation has a Name.</lines>
