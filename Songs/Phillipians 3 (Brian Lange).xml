    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>What things were gain to us<br/>We count them all as loss.<br/>Our pride, the things we've done,<br/>They're rubbish and they're dross.<br/>That we might know you fully,<br/>And be found in only You.<br/>Our righteousness isn't from the law;<br/>It's Your Son that made us new.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>That we may know<br/>the power of Your resurrection.<br/>Not that we have<br/>already attained perfection,<br/>But one thing we do:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Forgetting those things which are behind,<br/>We reach forward for the upward call of Christ.<br/>The call of Christ.<br/>Lord, strip us of what we hold dear,<br/>The worldly things that will never compare to You.<br/>Compare to You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Where lies your confidence?<br/>In what do you place worth?<br/>Only when you share His death<br/>Will faith, to you, give birth.<br/>Suffer with Him, know His power,<br/>Press on toward the goal.<br/>His righteousness will hold you true,<br/>His call is to be whole!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>So eagerly we wait<br/>For Christ the Son to come;<br/>Our citizenship is found<br/>In heaven.</lines>
