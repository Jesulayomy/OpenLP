    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>What do you think about when you look at me<br/>I know were not the fairy tale you dreamed wed be<br/>You wore the veil, you walked the aisle, you took my hand<br/>And we dove into a mystery</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How I wish we could go back to simpler times<br/>Before all our scars and all our secrets were in the light<br/>Now on this hallowed ground, we've drawn the battle lines<br/>Will we make it through the night</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>Its going to take much more than promises this time<br/>Only God can change our minds</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete<br/>Could we just be broken together<br/>If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine<br/>Could healing still be spoken and save us<br/>The only way well last forever is broken together</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>How it must have been so lonely by my side<br/>We were building kingdoms and chasing dreams and left love behind<br/>I'm praying God will help our broken hearts align<br/>And we won't give up the fight</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p2">
      <lines>Its going to take much more than promises this time<br/>Only God can change our minds</lines>

      <lines>Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete<br/>Could we just be broken together<br/>If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine<br/>Could healing still be spoken and save us<br/>The only way well last forever is broken together</lines>
