    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Zacchaeus was a wee little man,<br/>and a wee little man was he.<br/>He climbed up in a sycamore tree<br/>For the Lord he wanted to see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And when the Savior passed that way<br/>He looked up in the tree.<br/>And said, 'Zacchaeus, you come down!<br/>For I'm going to your house today!<br/>For I'm going to your house today!'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Zacchaeus was a wee little man,<br/>But a happy man was he,<br/>For he had seen the Lord that day<br/>And a happy man was he;<br/>And a very happy man was he.</lines>
