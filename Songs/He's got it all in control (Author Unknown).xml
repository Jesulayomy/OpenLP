      <lines>He's got it all in control<br/>He's got it all in control<br/>He's put that reassurance<br/>Way down in my soul<br/>He's got it all in control</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I've put my life in His hands<br/>I've put my life in His hands<br/>So every road I walk down<br/>I'm sure is in His plan<br/>'Cause I've put my life in His hands</lines>
