    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Here is love vast as the ocean,<br/>Loving kindness as the flood,<br/>When the Prince of life, our ransom<br/>Shed for us His precious blood.<br/>Who His love will not remember?<br/>Who can cease to sing His praise?<br/>He can never be forgotten<br/>Throughout heaven’s eternal days.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>On the Mount of Crucifixion<br/>Fountains opened deep and wide;<br/>Through the floodgates of God’s mercy<br/>Flowed a vast and gracious tide.<br/>Grace and love, like mighty rivers,<br/>Poured incessant from above,<br/>And heaven’s peace and perfect justice<br/>Kissed a guilty world in love.</lines>
