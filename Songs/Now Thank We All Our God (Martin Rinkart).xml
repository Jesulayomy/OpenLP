    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Now thank we all our God,<br/>With hearts and hands and voices; <br/>Who wondrous things has done, <br/>In whom His world rejoices; <br/>Who from our motherâ€™s arms <br/>Has blessed us on our way <br/>With countless gifts of love, <br/>And still is ours today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O may this bounteous God <br/>Through all our life be near us, <br/>With ever joyful hearts <br/>And blessed peace to cheer us; <br/>And keep us in His grace, <br/>And guide us when perplexed, <br/>And free us from all ills <br/>In this world and the next.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>All praise and thanks to God <br/>The Father now be given, <br/>The Son, and Him who reigns <br/>With them in highest heaven, <br/>The one eternal God, <br/>Whom earth and heaven adore; <br/>For thus it was, is now, <br/>And shall be ever more.</lines>
