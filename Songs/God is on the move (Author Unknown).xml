    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Anytime a heart turns from darkness to light<br/>Anytime temptation comes and someone stands to fight<br/>Anytime somebody lives to serve and not be served<br/>I know, I know, I know, I know</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>God is on the move, on the move Hallelujah<br/>God is on the move in many mighty ways<br/>God is on the move, on the move Hallelujah<br/>God is on the move on the move today</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Anytime in weakness someone falls upon their knees<br/>Or dares to speak the truth that sets men free<br/>Anytime the choice is made to stand upon the Word<br/>I know, I know, I know, I know</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I see a generation standing on the truth<br/>In each and every nation God is on the move<br/>Anytime the gospel stirs a searching soul<br/>And someone says, "Send me, here I go"<br/>I know, I know, I know, I know</lines>
    </verse>
