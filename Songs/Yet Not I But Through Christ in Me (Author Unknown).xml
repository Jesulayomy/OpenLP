    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer<br/>There is no more for heaven now to give<br/>He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom<br/>My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus<br/>For my life is wholly bound to his<br/>Oh how strange and divine, I can sing: all is mine!<br/>Yet not I, but through Christ in me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The night is dark but I am not forsaken<br/>For by my side, the Saviour He will stay<br/>I labour on in weakness and rejoicing<br/>For in my need, His power is displayed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me<br/>Through the deepest valley He will lead<br/>Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome!<br/>Yet not I, but through Christ in me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven<br/>The future sure, the price it has been paid<br/>For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon<br/>And He was raised to overthrow the grave</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>To this I hold, my sin has been defeated<br/>Jesus now and ever is my plea<br/>Oh the chains are released, I can sing: I am free!<br/>Yet not I, but through Christ in me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>With every breath I long to follow Jesus<br/>For He has said that He will bring me home<br/>And day by day I know He will renew me<br/>Until I stand with joy before the throne</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c4">
      <lines>To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus<br/>All the glory evermore to Him<br/>When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat:<br/>Yet not I, but through Christ in me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c5">
      <lines>When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat:<br/>Yet not I, but through Christ in me!<br/>Yet not I, but through Christ in me!<br/>Yet not I, but through Christ in me!</lines>
