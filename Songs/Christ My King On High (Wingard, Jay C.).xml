    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, my sin, it grieves me so. How I long for my Lord to come. Bless my God who clothes me bright, wraps me pure in heav'n's Great Light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Spotless Lamb made sin for me. God, Great Judge, just always be. Sealed on high with Christ's Great Pledge never more shall death I dread.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>One with Him, I stand secure, Safe in Triune hands I'm sure. Christ's great merits giv'n to me. I now hear Him say, "Whom I'm pleased."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Long to see the skies burn bright, heaven's hosts all clothed in white. See the King, His vic'try won. Come, pure Bride behold the Son.</lines>
    </verse>
