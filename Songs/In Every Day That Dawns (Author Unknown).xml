    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In every day that dawns,<br/>I see the light of Your splendour around me;<br/>And everywhere I turn,<br/>I know the gift of Your favour upon me.<br/>What can I do but give You glory, Lord?<br/>Everything good has come from You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'm grateful for the air I breathe,<br/>I'm so thankful for this life I live,<br/>For the mercies that You pour on me,<br/>And the blessings that meet every need.<br/>And the grace that is changing me<br/>From a hopeless case to a child that's free,<br/>Free to give You praise, for in everything<br/>I know You love me. I know You love me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Through all that I have known,<br/>I have been held in the shelter of Your hand;<br/>And as my life unfolds,<br/>You are revealing the wisdom<br/>Of Your sovereign plan.<br/>There are no shadows in Your faithfulness,<br/>There are no limits to Your love.</lines>
    </verse>
