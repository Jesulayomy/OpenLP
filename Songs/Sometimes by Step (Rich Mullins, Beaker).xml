    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sometimes the night was beautiful. Sometimes the sky was so far away.<br/>Sometimes it seemed to stoop so close you could touch it, but your heart would break.<br/>Sometimes the morning came too soon. Sometimes the day could be so hard.<br/>There was so much work left to do, but so much you'd already done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh God, You are my God,  and I will ever praise You.<br/>Oh God, You are my God,  and I will ever praise You.<br/>I will seek You in the morning,<br/>And I will learn to walk in Your ways.<br/>And step by step, You'll lead me,<br/>And I will follow You all of my days.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sometimes I think of Abraham, how one star he saw had been lit for me.<br/>He was a stranger in this land, and I am that no less than he.<br/>And on this road to righteousness, sometimes the climb can be so steep;<br/>I may falter in my steps, but never beyond Your reach.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>And I will follow You all of my days.<br/>And I will follow You all of my days.<br/>And step by step, You'll lead me,<br/>And I will follow You all of my days.</lines>
