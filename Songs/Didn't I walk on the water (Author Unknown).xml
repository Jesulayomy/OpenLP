    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As I kneel in the darkness in the middle of the night<br/>I'm praying for assurance everything's gonna be alright<br/>Lord I see another battle out in front of me<br/>I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go down in defeat</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He said, do you remember where I brought you from<br/>Just take a look behind you at how far you've come<br/>And everytime you asked me, didn't I deliver you<br/>So why would you be thinking that I wouldn't see you through</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Didn't I walked on the water and I calmed the raging sea<br/>I spoke to the wind, it hushed and I gave you peace<br/>Didn't I run to your rescue didn't I hear you when you called<br/>I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall<br/>Didn't I leave all of Heaven just to die for your sin<br/>I searched until I found you and I'd do it all again</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now she's talking to her father in a house that was once a home<br/>She said my bills are coming due Lord and six days is not that long<br/>She hears a voice so still and low<br/>It says I've moved like that before<br/>And I'll do this little thing and I'll give you so much more</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Didn't I walked on the water and I calmed the raging sea<br/>I spoke to the wind, it hushed and I gave you peace<br/>Didn't I run to your rescue didn't I hear you when you called<br/>I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall<br/>Didn't I leave all of Heaven just to die for your sin<br/>I searched until I found you and I'd do it all again (2X)</lines>
