    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He leadeth me! O blessed thought! O words with heavenly comfort fraught!<br/>Whate'er I do, where'er I be, Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine, Nor ever murmur nor repine,<br/>Content, whatever lot I see, Since God through Jordan leadeth me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And when my task on earth is done, When by Thy grace the victory's won,<br/>E'en death's cold wave I will not flee, Since God through Jordan leadeth me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>He leadeth me, He leadeth me; By His own hand He leadeth me:<br/>His faithful follower I would be, For by His hand He leadeth me.</lines>
