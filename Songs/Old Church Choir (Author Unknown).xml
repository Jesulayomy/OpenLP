    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's revival and it's spreading<br/>Like a wildfire in my heart<br/>A Sunday morning hallelujah<br/>And it's lasting all week long</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Can you hear it? Can you feel it?<br/>It's the rhythm of a gospel song<br/>Once you choose it, you can't lose it<br/>There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I've got an old church choir singing in my soul<br/>I've got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful<br/>I've got a heart overflowing cause I've been restored<br/>No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy<br/>No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When the valleys that I wander<br/>Turn to mountains that I can't climb<br/>You are with me, you never leave me<br/>There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>I've got an old church choir singing in my soul<br/>I've got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful<br/>I've got a heart overflowing cause I've been restored<br/>No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy<br/>No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Clap your hands and stomp your feet<br/>Till you find that gospel beat<br/>Cause He's all you'll ever need<br/>He's all you'll ever need</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>I've got an old church choir singing in my soul<br/>I've got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful<br/>I've got a heart overflowing cause I've been restored<br/>No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy<br/>No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy<br/>No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy</lines>
