    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>From the dust of the earth<br/>my God created man-<br/>His breath made man a living soul;<br/>And God so loved the world<br/>He gave His only Son,<br/>and that is why I love Him so!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>My hands were made<br/>to help my neighbor,<br/>my eyes were made<br/>to read God's word.<br/>My feet were made<br/>to walk in His footsteps,<br/>my body is the temple of the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I was made in His likeness,<br/>created in his image,<br/>for I was born to serve the Lord.<br/>And I cannot deny Him,<br/>I will always walk beside Him,<br/>for I was born to the serve the Lord.</lines>
