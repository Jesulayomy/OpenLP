    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He left the splendour of Heaven,<br/>knowing His destiny<br/>was the lonely hill of Calvary<br/>where He laid down His life for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>If that isn't love,<br/>the ocean is dry,<br/>there's no stars in the sky,<br/>and the sparrow can't fly.<br/>If that isn't love,<br/>then heaven's a myth,<br/>there's no feeling like this,<br/>if that isn't love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Even in death He remembered<br/>the thief hanging by His side.<br/>He spoke with love and compassion,<br/>then He took Him to paradise.</lines>
    </verse>
