    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Let no one caught in sin remain<br/>Inside the lie of inward shame,<br/>But fix our eyes upon the cross<br/>And run to Him who showed great love<br/>And bled for us.<br/>Freely You've bled for us.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Christ is risen from the dead,<br/>Trampling over death by death.<br/>Come awake! Come awake!<br/>Come and rise up from the grave!<br/>Christ is risen from the dead,<br/>We are one with Him again.<br/>Come awake! Come awake!<br/>Come and rise up from the grave!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Beneath the weight of all our sin,<br/>You bowed to none but heaven's will.<br/>No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown,<br/>No burden great can hold You down.<br/>In strength, You reign.<br/>Forever let Your church proclaim:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>O, death where is your sting?<br/>O, hell where is your victory?<br/>O, church come stand in the light!<br/>The glory of God has defeated the night!<br/>Singing O, death where is your sting?<br/>O, hell where is your victory?<br/>O, church come stand in the light!<br/>Our God is not dead! He's alive! He's alive!</lines>
