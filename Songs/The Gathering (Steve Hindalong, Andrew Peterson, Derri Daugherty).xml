    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sis-ters, brothers, we've got to learn to love each other.<br/>Our Father in heaven has called us to be instruments of peace.<br/>Children of His mer-cy, the time has come to face the sun and hold up high<br/>The banner of love of the Lord until we gather in the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>All God's children of love and light, every heart will be uni-fied,<br/>Singing praise to the Lord our King on the day of the gathering,<br/>On the day of the gathering.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Children of love and light:<br/>We are the body of Christ, the kingdom come,<br/>The hands and feet of His will be done; a torch in the dark of a dying place,<br/>The living light of His saving grace, the living light of amazing grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Love and light, children of love and light,<br/>Love and light, children of love and light,<br/>Love and light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sis-ters, brothers, we've got to learn to love each other.<br/>Our Father in heaven has called us to be instruments of peace.<br/>Je-sus is the Prince of Peace.</lines>
