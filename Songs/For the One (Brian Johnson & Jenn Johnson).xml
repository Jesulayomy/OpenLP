    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse: 1<br/>Let me be filled<br/>With kindness and compassion for the one<br/>The one for whom you   loved and gave your son<br/>For humanity increase my love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Help me to love with open arms like you do<br/>A love that erases all the lines and sees the truth<br/>Oh that when they look in my eyes they would see You<br/>Even in just a smile they would feel the Father's love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse: 2<br/>Oh how you love us<br/>From the homeless to the famous and in-between<br/>You formed us, You   made us carefully<br/>'Cause    in the end, we're all your children</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>Let all my life   tell of who you are<br/>And the wonder of Your    never-ending love<br/>Let all my life   tell of who you are<br/>You're wonderful and    such a good Father.</lines>
