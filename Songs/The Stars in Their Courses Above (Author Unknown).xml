    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The stars in their courses above<br/>Shine for Your glory; You alone are God<br/>By You every mountain was formed<br/>To tell of the story; You alone are God<br/>Eternally worthy of praise<br/>We join with creation and sing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord, for all that You are<br/>For all that You've done<br/>I will praise You<br/>Lord, for all that You are<br/>For all that You'll do<br/>I will praise You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The roar of Your thunder and rain<br/>Tell of Your power; You alone are God<br/>The people You've called and redeemed<br/>Bow in surrender; You alone are God<br/>Eternally worthy of praise<br/>We join with creation and sing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Never ending, unfailing<br/>Everlasting, unfading<br/>You are</lines>
