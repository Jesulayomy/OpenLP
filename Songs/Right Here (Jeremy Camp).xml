    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All the world is watching.<br/>All the world does care.<br/>Even when the world weighs on my shoulder now,<br/>These feelings I can bear<br/>Because I know that You're here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Everywhere I go, I know You're not far away.<br/>You're right here. You're right here. (2X)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All these thoughts I've wasted,<br/>All these thoughts I've feared,<br/>Even when these thoughts are faded,<br/>I still know that You hear,<br/>And I can rest my hope in You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>The many times that I have felt alone,<br/>The many times that I have felt the world was crashing down upon me,<br/>You always stood here by my side.<br/>You were always there.</lines>
