    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All my past, my tainted name,<br/>You stole its legacy of pride and shame.<br/>You're all I love, You're all I fear.<br/>I'm drawing near to face You, to know You, to show You</lines>

    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>You found me in a shallow grave.<br/>You dragged me out from beneath it all.<br/>You healed me, saved me<br/>In the nick of time, Your perfect time.<br/>You found me in a shallow grave.<br/>You called me out from beneath it all.<br/>You touched me, saved me<br/>In the nick of time, in Your perfect time.<br/>I devote all I have to You.<br/>I devote all that You've made new,<br/>All You restored that day You bled,<br/>All that You brought back from the dead. Oh!</lines>
