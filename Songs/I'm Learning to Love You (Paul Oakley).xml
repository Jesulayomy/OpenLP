    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'm learning to love You, to love and trust You.<br/>I'm learning to give You  all that I am.<br/>I'm learning to cling to  the words You have spoken.<br/>I'm learning to let go, my life in Your hands.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>For You are faithful, In all of Your ways,<br/>In wisdom unsearchable, and full of grace.<br/>Oh, You are beautiful beyond words.<br/>I'm learning to love You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So teach me to love You, to love and to trust You,<br/>And teach me to give You, all that I am.<br/>And teach me to cling to the words You have spoken;<br/>Teach me to let go, my life in Your hands.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>We are like shadows that change with the day;<br/>And like the flowers, our beauty will fade.<br/>But Your's is the kingdom and the power,<br/>Forever and ever, Your glory will always remain.</lines>
