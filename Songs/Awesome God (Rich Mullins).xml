  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh when He rolls up his sleeves, He ain't just puttin' on the ritz;<br/>Our God is an awesome God.<br/>There is thunder in His footsteps and lightning in His fists;<br/>Our God is an awesome God.<br/>And the Lord wasn't joking when He kicked 'em out of Eden,<br/>It wasn't for no reason that He shed his blood.<br/>His return is very close and so you'd better be believin' that<br/>Our God is an awesome God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Our God is an awesome God, He reigns from heaven above<br/>With wisdom, pow'r, and love; our God is an awesome God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And when the sky was starless in the void of the night,<br/>Our God is an awesome God.<br/>He spoke into the darkness and created the light,<br/>Our God is an awesome God.<br/>Judgment and wrath He poured out on Sodom,<br/>Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross.<br/>I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that<br/>Our God is an awesome God.</lines>
