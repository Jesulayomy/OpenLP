    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How can I say thanks<br/>for the things you have done for me<br/>Things so undeserved<br/>Yet you give to prove your love for me<br/>The voices of a million angels<br/>Could not express my gratitude<br/>All that I am and ever hope to be<br/>I owe it all to Thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>To God be the glory<br/>To God be the glory<br/>To God be the glory<br/>For the things He has done<br/>With His blood, He has saved me<br/>With His power, He has raised me.<br/>To God be the glory<br/>For the things he has done</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Just let me live my life<br/>Let it be pleasing, Lord to Thee<br/>Should I gain any praise,<br/>Let it go to Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>With His blood, He has saved me<br/>With His power, He has raised me.<br/>To God be the glory<br/>For the things he has done.</lines>
