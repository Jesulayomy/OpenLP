    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You steady me<br/>Slow and sweet, we sway<br/>Take the lead and I will follow<br/>Finally ready now<br/>To close my eyes and just believe<br/>That You won't lead me<br/>Where You don't go</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When my faith gets tired<br/>And my hope seems lost<br/>You spin me round and round<br/>And remind me of that song<br/>The one You wrote for me<br/>And we dance</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And I've been told<br/>To pick up my sword<br/>And fight for love<br/>Little did I know<br/>That Love had won for me<br/>Here in Your arms</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>You still my heart again<br/>And I breathe You in<br/>Like I've never breathed 'till now</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>When my faith gets tired<br/>And my hope seems lost<br/>You spin me round and round<br/>And remind me of that song<br/>The one You wrote for me<br/>And we dance<br/>And I will lock eyes<br/>With the One who's ransomed me<br/>The One who gave me joy for mourning<br/>And I will lock eyes<br/>With the One who's chosen me<br/>The One who set my feet to dancing?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>We dance<br/>Just You and me<br/>It's nice to know I'm not alone<br/>I found my home here in Your arms<br/>It's nice to know I'm not alone?<br/>I found my home here in Your arms<br/>It's nice to know I'm not alone<br/>I found my home here in Your arms</lines>
    </verse>
