    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I am surrounded<br/>On every side, can't see the light of day<br/>But I am persuaded<br/>Beyond all hope, You won't let go of me<br/>I stake my claim on every word You say<br/>You will not be late</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I will sing through ﬁre and thunder<br/>'Cause You are on my side<br/>I trust You with my life<br/>I know my story, it isn't over<br/>Even against all odds<br/>You are a faithful God<br/>You're faithful God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The darkest of weather<br/>Though I can't see, I still believe You're good<br/>So I'm moving forward<br/>Through crashing waves, I know I'm safe with You<br/>You hold my life, You hear my cry<br/>With every breath inside</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I am convinced that Your promises will hold together<br/>And I will dwell in the hope of Your love forever<br/>I am convinced that Your promises will hold together<br/>And I will dwell in Your love</lines>
