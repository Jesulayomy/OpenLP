    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In peace and joy I now depart At God's disposing; For full of comfort is my heart, Soft reposing. So the Lord hath promised me, And death is but a slumber.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>'Tis Christ that wrought this work for me, My faithful Savior, Whom Thou hast made mine eyes to see By Thy favor. Now I know He is my Life, My Help in need and dying.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Him Thou hast unto all set forth Their great Salvation And to His kingdom called the earth, Every nation, By Thy dear and wholesome Word, In every place resounding.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He is the Hope and saving Light Of lands benighted; By Him are they who dwelt in night Fed and lighted. He is Israel's Praise and Bliss, Their Joy, Reward, and Glory.</lines>
