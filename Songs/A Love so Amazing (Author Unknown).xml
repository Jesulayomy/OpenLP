    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And You will always be<br/>The King on the throne<br/>Now Your praise will always be on my tongue<br/>No one else could do<br/>The things that You've done in my life<br/>There's no greater love that's ever been shown<br/>Now Your song in me just has to be sung<br/>No one else could do the things that You've done In my life</lines>

      <lines>You said if I follow You<br/>I'll know the truth and do the things You do<br/>Yours is the kingdom and the power<br/>Forever Lord You will always be my God</lines>
