    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is a voice that must be heard,<br/>There is a song that must be sung;<br/>There is a name that must be lifted high.<br/>There is a treasure more than gold,<br/>There is a King upon the throne;<br/>There is one whose praise will fill the skies.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His name is Jesus, friend of sinners,<br/>Jesus, Jesus, friend of mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There is a peace that calms our fears,<br/>There is a love stronger than death;<br/>There is a hope that goes beyond the grave.<br/>There is a Friend who won't let go,<br/>There is a heart that beats for You;<br/>There is one name by which we are saved.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When I was captive to my fears,<br/>You were the one who came to me,<br/>You set me free.</lines>
