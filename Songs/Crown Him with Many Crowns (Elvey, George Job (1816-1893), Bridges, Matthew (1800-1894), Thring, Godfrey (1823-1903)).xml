    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne;<br/>Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns, all music but its own;<br/>Awake my soul and sing, of Him who died for Thee,<br/>And hail Him as Thy matchless King through all eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed o'er the grave;<br/>And rose victorious in the strife, for those He came to save;<br/>His glories now we sing, who died and rose on high,<br/>Who died eternal life to bring and lives that death may die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of love, behold His hands and side;<br/>Rich wounds yet visible above, in beauty glorified;<br/>All hail Redeemer hail, for Thou hast died for me,<br/>Thy praise shall never, never fail, throughout eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
