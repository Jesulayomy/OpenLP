    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As I looked out accross the land,<br/>I see God's mighty hand<br/>A Bride of Christ adorned in wedding gown.<br/>Just like in the days of old<br/>They stood with courrag bold.<br/>They turned this old world upside down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now the bible plainly tells<br/>how the Holy Ghost fell<br/>Signs and wonders were done<br/>by the appostles hands<br/>Demon spirits were cast out<br/>And in jail the sung and shout<br/>while surrounded<br/>by God's holy Angel band</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Well if you think it's all long gone<br/>and the miracles are done.<br/>I have some good news to bring to you<br/>In the last days He'll pour<br/>of His spirit, more and more<br/>Like a mighty eagle,<br/>His strength He'll renew.</lines>
