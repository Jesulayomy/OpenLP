    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I stand amazed in the presence<br/>Of Jesus the Nazarene,<br/>And wonder how He could love me,<br/>A sinner condemned, unclean.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>How marvelous! How wonderful!<br/>And my song shall ever be:<br/>How marvelous! How wonderful!<br/>Is my Savior's love for me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For me it was in the garden,<br/>He prayed: "Not my will, but Thine."<br/>He had no tears for His own griefs,<br/>But sweat-drops of blood for mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In pity angels beheld Him,<br/>And came from the world of light<br/>To strengthen Him in the sorrows<br/>He bore for my soul that night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He took my sins and my sorrows,<br/>He made them His very own;<br/>He bore the burden to Calv'ry,<br/>And suffered, and died alone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>When with the ransomed in glory<br/>His face I at last shall see,<br/>'Twill be my joy through the ages<br/>To sing of His love for me.</lines>
    </verse>
