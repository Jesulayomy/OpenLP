    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse:<br/>Unreserved, unrestrained<br/>Your love is wild, Your love is wild for me<br/>It isn't shy, it's unashamed<br/>Your love is proud to be seen with me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>You don't give Your heart in pieces<br/>You don't hide Yourself to tease us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse:<br/>Uncontrolled, un-contained<br/>Your love is a fire burning bright for me<br/>It's not just a spark, it's not just a flame<br/>Your love is a light, and all the world will see</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>Your love's not fractured<br/>It's not a troubled mind<br/>It isn't anxious it's not the restless kind<br/>Your love's not passive<br/>It's never disengaged<br/>It's always present<br/>It hangs on every word we say<br/>Love keeps its promises,it keeps its word<br/>It honors what's sacred, cause its vows are good<br/>Your love's not broken<br/>It's not insecure<br/>Your love's not selfish, Your love is pure</lines>
