    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Why are you striving these days?<br/>Why are you trying to earn grace?<br/>Why are you crying? Let me lift up your face.<br/>Just don't turn away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Why are you looking for love?<br/>Why are you still searching as if I'm not enough?<br/>To where will you go, child?<br/>Tell me where will you run?<br/>To where will you run?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>'Cause I'll be by your side wherever you fall,<br/>In the dead of night, whenever you call,<br/>And please don't fight these hands that are holding you.<br/>Yeah, my hands are holding you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Look at these hands and My side.<br/>They swallowed the grave on that night<br/>When I drank the world's sin so I could carry you in<br/>And give you life. I wanna give you life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Cause I, I love you.<br/>I want you to know.<br/>That I, I love you.<br/>I'll never let you go.</lines>
