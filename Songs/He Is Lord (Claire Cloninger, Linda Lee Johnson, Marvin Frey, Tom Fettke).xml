  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Emptied of His glory, God became a man<br/>To walk on earth in ridicule and shame;<br/>A Ruler yet a Servant, a Shepherd yet a Lamb,<br/>A Man of sorrows, agony, and pain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Humbled and rejected, beaten and despised,<br/>Upon the cross the Son of God was slain;<br/>Just like a lamb to slaughter: a sinless Sacrifice,<br/>But by His death His loss became our gain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>He is Lord, He is Lord!<br/>He has risen from the dead and He is Lord!<br/>Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess<br/>that Jesus Christ is Lord!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Satan's forces crumbled like a mighty wall,<br/>The stone that held Him in was rolled aside;<br/>The Prince of Life in glory was lifted over all,<br/>Now earth and heaven echo with the cry!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>You are Lord, You are Lord!<br/>You have risen from the dead and You are Lord!<br/>And my knee shall bow, and my tongue confess<br/>that Jesus Christ is Lord!</lines>
    </verse>
