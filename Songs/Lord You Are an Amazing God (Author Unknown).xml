    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Looking in the sky,<br/>whoever could deny Your glory?<br/>Gazing into space,<br/>how small the human race appears.<br/>Seeing You in all Your majesty,<br/>I wonder how it could be<br/>That You delight in me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord You are an amazing God<br/>Lord You are an amazing God<br/>Lord You are an amazing God<br/>And I love You, I love You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord of everything, no other god or king is like You.<br/>Powerful and strong,<br/>yet tender is Your song to me.<br/>Knowing the extent of all my sin,<br/>however could You be pleased<br/>To pour Your love on me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>You light up the heavens with just one word,<br/>You measure the mountains in Your hand;<br/>Yet You treasure the broken<br/>and make them whole,<br/>You crown us with Your love.</lines>
