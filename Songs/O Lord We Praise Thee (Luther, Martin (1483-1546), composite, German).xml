    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O Lord, we praise Thee, bless Thee, and adore Thee, In thanksgiving bow before Thee Thou with Thy body and Thy blood didst nourish Our weak souls that they may flourish: O Lord, have mercy! May Thy body, Lord, born of Mary, That our sins and sorrows did carry, And Thy blood for us plead In all trial, fear, and need: O Lord, have mercy!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Thy holy body into death was given, Life to win for us in heaven. No greater love than this to Thee could bind us; May this feast thereof remind us! O Lord, have mercy! Lord, Thy kindness did so constrain Thee That Thy blood should bless and sustain me. All our debt Thou hast paid; Peace with God once more is made: O Lord, have mercy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>May God bestow on us His grace and favor To please Him with our behavior And live as brethren here in love and union Nor repent this blest Communion! O Lord, have mercy! Let not Thy good Spirit forsake us; Grant that heav'nly\minded He make us; Give Thy Church, Lord, to see Days of peace and unity: O Lord, have mercy!</lines>
