    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Begone unbelief,<br/>My Savior is near,<br/>And for my relief<br/>Will surely appear:<br/>By prayer let me wrestle,<br/>And he will perform,<br/>With Christ in the vessel,<br/>I smile at the storm.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Tho' dark be my way,<br/>Since he is my guide,<br/>'Tis mine to obey,<br/>'Tis his to provide:<br/>To' cisterns be broken,<br/>And creatures all fail,<br/>The word he has spoken<br/>Shall surely prevail.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His love in time past<br/>Forbids me to think<br/>He'll leave me at last<br/>In trouble to sink'<br/>Each sweet Ebenezer<br/>I have in review<br/>confirms his good pleasure<br/>To help me quite through.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Why should I complain<br/>Of want or distress<br/>Temptation or pain?<br/>He told me no less;<br/>The heirs of salvation,<br/>I knew from his word,<br/>Through much tribulation,<br/>Must follow their Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>How bitter the cup,<br/>No heart can conceive,<br/>Which he drunk quite up,<br/>That sinners might live!<br/>His way was much rougher,<br/>And darker than mine;<br/>Did Jesus thus suffer,<br/>And shall I repine?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Since all that I meet<br/>Shall work for my good,<br/>The bitter is sweet,<br/>The medicine is food;<br/>Though painful at present,<br/>'Twill cease before long,<br/>And then, oh how pleasant,<br/>The conqueror's song!</lines>
    </verse>
