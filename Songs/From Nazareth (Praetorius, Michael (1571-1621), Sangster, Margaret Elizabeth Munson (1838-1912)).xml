  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Comes any good from Nazareth? The scornful challenge as of old Is flung on many'a jeering breath From cloistered cells and marts of gold.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Comes any good from Nazareth? Behold, the mighty Nazarene, The Lord of life, the Lord of death, Through warring ages walks serene.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>One touch upon His garment's fringe Still heals the hurt of bitter years. Before Him yet the demons cringe, He gives the wine of joy for tears.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O city of the Carpenter, Upon the hill slope old and gray, The world among its pain and stir Turns yearning eyes on thee today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>For He who dwelt in Nazareth, And wrought with toil of hand and brain, Alone gives victory to faith Until the day He come again.</lines>
    </verse>
