  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A mighty fortress is our God, a Bulwark never failing;<br/>Our Helper He amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing;<br/>For still our ancient Foe doth seek to work us woe;<br/>His craft and pow'r are great, and armed with cruel hate,<br/>On earth is not his equal.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing;<br/>Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God's own choosing;<br/>Dost ask who that may be: Christ Jesus it is He;<br/>Lord Sabbaoth His name, from age to age the same,<br/>And He must win the battle.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And though this world with devils filled should threaten to undo us;<br/>We will not fear for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us:<br/>The prince of darkness grim, we tremble not for him;<br/>His rage we can endure for lo, his doom is sure,<br/>One little word shall fell him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>That Word above all earthly pow'r, no thanks to them abideth;<br/>The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him who with us sideth;<br/>Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;<br/>The body they may kill; God's truth abideth still,<br/>His kingdom is forever!</lines>
    </verse>
