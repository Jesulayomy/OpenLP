    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Gospel shows the Father's grace, Who sent his Son to save our race, Proclaims how Jesus lived and died That man might thus be justified.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It sets the Lamb before our eyes, Who made th'atoning sacrifice, And calls the souls with guilt oppressed To come and find eternal rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>It brings the Savior's righteousness Our souls to robe in royal dress; From all our guilt it brings release And gives the troubled conscience peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>It is the pow'r of God to save From sin and Satan and the grave; It works the faith, which firmly clings To all the treasures which it brings.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>It bears to all the tidings glad And bids their hearts no more be sad; The heavy laden souls it cheers And banishes their guilty fears.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>May we in faith its tidings learn<br/>Nor thanklessly its blessings spurn;<br/>May we in faith its truth confess<br/>And praise the Lord our Righteousness!</lines>
    </verse>
