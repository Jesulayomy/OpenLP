    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a voice in the silence,<br/>Piercing the darkness of my own selfish soul<br/>There's a cry deep within me, a yearning to feel you<br/>I look to you, Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>I can pretend I don't run from the feelings<br/>I'm trying to hide<br/>Must get the focus of me and my problems<br/>I look to the cross</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You are my Rock jn You I stand<br/>Safe from the storms that surround me<br/>You're my only Rock, In you I can<br/>Don't have to rely on my own strength.</lines>
