    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, The emblem of suff'ring and shame;<br/>And I love that old cross where the dearest and best, For a world of lost sinners was slain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,<br/>Till my trophies at last I lay down;<br/>I will cling to the old rugged cross,<br/>And exchange it some day for a crown.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, Has a wondrous attraction for me;<br/>For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above, To bear it to dark Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,<br/>Till my trophies at last I lay down;<br/>I will cling to the old rugged cross,<br/>And exchange it some day for a crown.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine, A wondrous beauty I see;<br/>For twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died, To pardon and sanctify me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,<br/>Till my trophies at last I lay down;<br/>I will cling to the old rugged cross,<br/>And exchange it some day for a crown.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>To the old rugged cross I will ever be true, Its shame and reproach gladly bear;<br/>Then He'll call me some day to my home far away, Where his glory forever I'll share.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c4">
      <lines>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,<br/>Till my trophies at last I lay down;<br/>I will cling to the old rugged cross,<br/>And exchange it some day for a crown.<br/>I will cling to the old rugged cross,<br/>And exchange it some day for a crown.</lines>
