    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come, your hearts and voices raising, Christ the Lord with gladness praising; Loudly sing His love amazing, Worthy folk of Christendom.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sin and death may well be groaning, Satan now may well be moaning; We, our full salvation owning, Cast our every care away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>See how God, for us providing, Gave His Son and life abiding; He our weary steps is guiding From earth's woe to heav'nly joy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Christ, from heav'n to us descending And in love our race befriending, In our need His help extending, Saved us from the wily Foe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Jacob's Star in all its splendor Beams with comfort sweet and tender, Forcing Satan to surrender, Breaking all the pow'rs of hell.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>From the bondage that oppressed us,<br/>From sin's fetters that possessed us,<br/>From the grief that sore distressed us,<br/>We, the captives, now are free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Oh, the joy beyond expressing<br/>When by faith we grasp this blessing<br/>And to Thee we come confessing,<br/>That our freedom thou hast wrought!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>Gracious Child, we pray Thee, hear us,<br/>From Thy lowly manger cheer us,<br/>Gently lead us and be near us<br/>Till we join the angelic choir.</lines>
    </verse>
