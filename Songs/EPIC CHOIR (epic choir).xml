    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>I was a leper outside the city<br/>None would come close<br/>But You wouldn't let go<br/>What worked back then<br/>Will work again<br/>I know the blood is still the blood<br/><br/>And I had an issue<br/>No one could help<br/>I tried them all<br/>My last try I crawled<br/>And what worked back then<br/>Will work again<br/>I know the blood is still the blood<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>And oh, how precious<br/>How beautiful<br/>This priceless love<br/>I've come to know<br/>And in the midst of<br/>My darkest storm<br/>I know the blood is still the blood<br/>It is, it is</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1c">
      <lines>I was just like Mary<br/>Labeled by shame<br/>They called my wrong<br/>But You called my name<br/>What worked back then<br/>Will work again<br/>'Cause I know the blood is still the blood<br/>I know the blood is still the blood<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1d">
      <lines>It washes white as snow <br/>The blood can make me whole<br/>It paid the debt I owe <br/>The blood has made me whole <br/></lines>

      <lines>He took my place <br/>Should've been me<br/></lines>

      <lines>Oh, how precious<br/>How beautiful<br/>This priceless love<br/>I've come to know<br/>In the midst of<br/>My darkest storm<br/>I know the blood is still the blood<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1g">
      <lines><br/>I know the blood is still the blood<br/>I know the blood is still the blood<br/>I know the blood is still the blood<br/>I know the blood is still the blood, oh<br/>I know the blood is still the blood, oh<br/>I know the blood is still the blood</lines>
