    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O breath of life, come sweeping through us,<br/>Revive Thy church with life and power. <br/>O Breath of Life, come, cleanse, renew us, <br/>And fit Thy church to meet this hour.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O Wind of God, come, bend us, break us, <br/>Till humbly we confess our need; <br/>Then in Thy tenderness remake us, <br/>Revive, restore; for this we plead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O Breath of Love, come, breathe within us,<br/>Renewing thought and will and heart: <br/>Come, love of Christ, afresh to win us, <br/>Revive Thy church in every part.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Revive us, Lord! is zeal abating <br/>While harvest fields are vast and white? <br/>Revive us, Lord, the world is waiting, <br/>Equip Thy church to spread the light.</lines>
