    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the harvest field now ripend,<br/>there is work for all to do.<br/>Hark the voice of God is calling,<br/>to the harvest calling you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus<br/>Little is much when God is in it,<br/>Labor not for wealth or fame;<br/>There's a crown and you can win it,<br/>if you go in Jesus' name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Does the place you're called to labor<br/>seem so small and little known?<br/>It is great if God is in it<br/>and He'll not forget His own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When the conflict here is ended<br/>and our race on earth is run;<br/>He will say, if you are faithful,<br/>"welcome home, my child well done".</lines>
