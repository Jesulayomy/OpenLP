    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Could've come like a mighty storm<br/>with all the strength of a hurricane<br/>You could've come like a forest fire<br/>with the power of heaven in your flame</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>But you came like a winter snow<br/>quiet and soft and slow<br/>Falling from the sky in the night<br/>to the earth below</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Could've swept in like a tidal wave<br/>or an ocean to ravish our hearts<br/>You could have come through like a roaring flood<br/>to wipe away the things we've scarred</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>No, your voice wasn't in a bush burning<br/>No, your voice wasn't in a rushing wind<br/>It was still, it was small, it was hidden</lines>
    </verse>
