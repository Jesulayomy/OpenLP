    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Thy Hand, O God has guided<br/>Thy flock, from age to age;<br/>The wondrous tale is written,<br/>Full clear on every page.<br/>Our fathers owned Thy goodness,<br/>And we their deeds record;<br/>And both of this bear witness:<br/>One Church, one Faith, one Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Thy heralds brought glad tidings<br/>To greatest as to least;<br/>They bade them rise and hasten<br/>To share the great King’s feast.<br/>And this was all their teaching<br/>In every deed and word;<br/>To all alike proclaiming:<br/>One Church, one Faith, one Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Through many a day of darkness,<br/>Through many a scene of strife,<br/>The faithful few fought bravely<br/>To guard the nation’s life.<br/>Their gospel of redemption,<br/>Sin pardoned, man restored,<br/>Was all in this enfolded:<br/>One Church, one Faith, one Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thy mercy will not fail us,<br/>Nor leave Thy work undone;<br/>With Thy right hand to help us,<br/>The victory shall be won.<br/>And then, by men and angels,<br/>Thy name shall be adored,<br/>And this shall be their anthem:<br/>One Church, one Faith, one Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
