    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When the music fades,<br/>All is stripped away,<br/>And I simply come,<br/>Longing just to bring<br/>Something that's of worth<br/>That will bless Your heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>I'll bring You more than a song,<br/>For a song in itself is not what You have required.<br/>You search much deeper within, through the way things appear;<br/>You're looking into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I'm coming back to the heartof worship,<br/>And it's all about You; it's all about You, Jesus;<br/>I'm sorry, Lord,<br/>for the thingI've made it<br/>When it's all about You; it's all about You, Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>King of endless worth,<br/>No one could express<br/>How much You deserve;<br/>Though I'm weak and poor,<br/>All I have is Yours,<br/>Every single breath.</lines>
