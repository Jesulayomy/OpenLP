  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Mary, did you know that your baby boy would some day walk on water?<br/>Mary, did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters?<br/>Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new?<br/>This child that you've delivered will soon deliver you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Mary, did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?<br/>Mary, did you know that your baby boy will calm the storm with his hand?<br/>Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod?<br/>When you've kissed your little baby, you've kissed the face of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Mary, did you know?  Mary, did you know?<br/>The blind will see, the deaf will hear, the dead will live again.<br/>The lame will leap, the dumb will speak, the praises of the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Mary, did you know that your baby boy is Lord of all creation?<br/>Mary, did you know that your baby boy will one day rule the nations?<br/>Did you know that your baby boy was heaven's perfect lamb?<br/>This sleeping child you're holding is the great "I AM".</lines>
