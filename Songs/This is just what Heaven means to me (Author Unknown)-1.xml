    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A country where no twilight shadows deepen<br/>Unending day where night will never be<br/>A city where no storm clouds ever gather<br/>This is just what Heaven means to m - e</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It's a place where there is no misunder - standing<br/>And from all enmity and strife we're free<br/>No unkind words to wound our hearts are spoken<br/>This is just what Heaven means to m - e</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>What will it be when we get over yonder<br/>And join the throng upon the glass - y sea<br/>We'll join our loved ones and crown Christ forever<br/>This is just what Heaven means to m - e</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And then at last I'll see the face of  Jesus<br/>And before whose image other loves all flee<br/>Ah, but when they crown Him Lord of All I'll be there<br/>This is just what Heaven means to m - e</lines>
    </verse>
