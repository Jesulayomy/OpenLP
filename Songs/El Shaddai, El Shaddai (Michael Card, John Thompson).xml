    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El Elyonna Adonai,<br/>Age to age You're still the same, by the power of the name.<br/>El Shaddai, El Shaddai, erkamkana Adonai,<br/>We will praise and lift You high, El Shaddai.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Through Your love and through the ram, You saved the son of Abraham,<br/>Through the power of Your hand You turned the sea into dry land.<br/>To the outcast on her knees You were the God who really sees,<br/>And by Your might You set Your children free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Through the years You made it clear that the time of Christ was near,<br/>Though the people couldn't see what Messiah ought to be.<br/>Though Your Word contained the plan, they just could not understand,<br/>Your most awesome work was done in the frailty of Your Son.</lines>
    </verse>
