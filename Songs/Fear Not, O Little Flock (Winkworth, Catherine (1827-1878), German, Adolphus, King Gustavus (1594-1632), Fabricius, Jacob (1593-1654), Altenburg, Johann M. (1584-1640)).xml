    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Fear not, O little flock, the foe Who madly seeks your overthrow; Dread not his rage and pow'r; What though your courage sometimes faints, His seeming triumph o'er God's saints Lasts but one little hour.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Be of good cheer; your cause belongs To Him who can avenge your wrongs; Leave it to Him our Lord. Though hidden yet from all our eyes, He sees the Gideon who shall rise; To save us, and His word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>As true as God's own word is true, Not earth nor hell with all their crew Against us shall prevail. A jest and by\word are they grown; God is with us, we are His own, Our vict'ry cannot fail.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Amen, Lord Jesus, grant our prayer! Great Captain, now Thine arm make bare; Fight for us once again. So shall thy saints and martyrs raise A mighty chorus to Thy praise, World without end. Amen.</lines>
