    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse:<br/>Come on everyone, See what he has done<br/>He has lifted us, He has overcome<br/>The power of the grave, and the sin that once enslaved<br/>Couldn't hold Him in the ground, couldn't keep him down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Rise with a shout, Cry out, Our God's alive<br/>Rise Holy Fire, Burn Bright, burn bright<br/>Rise with a shout, cry out for freedom<br/>Rise church arise, our God's alive</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse:<br/>Reigning on His throne, Drawing ever close<br/>Giving us this hope, He'll never let us go<br/>Death has been defeated, Jesus Christ Redeemer<br/>Conquered Hell and freed us, Forever we are saved</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>He alone can save us, He will not forsake us<br/>He remains forever,  our Savior<br/>See him reign in power Stronger than our failures<br/>Always and forever,   Our Savior</lines>
