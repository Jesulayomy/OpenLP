    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I cannot tell why He, whom angels worship,<br/>Should set His love upon the sons of men,<br/>Or why, as Shepherd, He should seek the wanderers,<br/>To bring them back, they know not how or when.<br/>But this I know, that He was born of Mary,<br/>When Bethlehem’s manger was His only home,<br/>And that He lived at Nazareth and laboured,<br/>And so the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I cannot tell how silently He suffered,<br/>As with His peace He graced this place of tears,<br/>Or how His heart upon the cross wasbroken,<br/>The crown of pain to three-and-thirty years.<br/>But this I know, He heals the broken-hearted,<br/>And stays our sin, and calms our lurkingfear,<br/>And lifts the burden from the heavy-laden,<br/>For yet the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I cannot tell how He will win the nations,<br/>How He will claim His earthly heritage,<br/>How satisfy the needs and aspirations<br/>Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.<br/>But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,<br/>And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,<br/>And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendour,<br/>When He the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is known.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,<br/>When, at his bidding, every storm is stilled,<br/>Or who can say how great the jubilation<br/>When all the hearts of men with love are filled.<br/>But this I know, the skies will thrill with rapture,<br/>And myriad, myriad human voices sing,<br/>And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth, will answer:<br/>‘At last the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is King!’</lines>
