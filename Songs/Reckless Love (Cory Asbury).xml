  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me.<br/>You have been so, so good to me.<br/>Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me.<br/>You have been so, so kind to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God<br/>Oh, it chases me down, fights 'till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine.<br/>I couldn't earn it. I don't deserve it. Still, You give yourself away.<br/>Oh the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me.<br/>You have been so, so good to me.<br/>When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me.<br/>You have been so, so kind to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, coming after me.<br/>There's no wall You won't kick down, no lie You won't tear down, coming after me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, coming after me.<br/>There's no wall You won't kick down, no lie You won't tear down, coming after me.<br/>There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, coming after me.<br/>There's no wall You won't kick down, no lie You won't tear down, coming after me.</lines>
