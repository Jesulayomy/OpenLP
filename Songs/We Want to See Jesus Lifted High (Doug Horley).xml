    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I want to see, I want to see, I want to see Jesus lifted high!<br/>I want to see, I want to see, I want to see Jesus lifted high!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I want to see Jesus lifted high,<br/>A banner that flies across the sky;<br/>That all men might see the truth and know,<br/>He is the way to heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high!<br/>We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Step by step we're moving forward,<br/>Little by little we're taking ground;<br/>Every prayer is a powerful weapon,<br/>Strongholds come tumbling down,<br/>And down and down and down...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>We're gonna see, we're gonna see, we're gonna see Jesus lifted high!<br/>We're gonna see, we're gonna see, we're gonna see Jesus lifted high!</lines>
