    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Did you feel the mountains tremble? Did you hear the oceans roar<br/>When the people rose to sing of<br/>    Jesus Christ, the Risen One?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Did you feel the people tremble?  Did you hear the singers roar<br/>When the lost began to sing of<br/>    Jesus Christ, the Saving One?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Do you feel the darkness tremble  when all the saints join in one song,<br/>And all the streams flow as one river<br/>to wash away our brokenness?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>And we can see that, God, You're moving,<br/>A mighty river through the nations,<br/>And young and old will turn to Jesus...<br/>Fling wide, you heavenly gates;<br/>Prepare the way of the risen Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p2">
      <lines>And here we see that, God, You're moving;<br/>A time of jubilee is coming,<br/>When young and old return to Jesus...<br/>Fling wide, you heavenly gates;<br/>Prepare the way of the risen Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Open up the doors and let the music play.<br/>Let the streets resound with singing:<br/>Songs that bring Your hope and songs that bring Your joy,<br/>Dancers who dance upon injustice.</lines>
    </verse>
