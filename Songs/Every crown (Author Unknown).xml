    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I have watched how You led through the wild<br/>A cloud by day and fire by night<br/>Guiding me to Your promised land<br/>Every step by my side</lines>

      <lines>All hail redeemer hail<br/>For You have died for me<br/>Your praise will never never fail<br/>Through all eternity</lines>
