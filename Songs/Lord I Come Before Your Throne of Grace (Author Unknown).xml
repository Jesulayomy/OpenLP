    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, I come before Your throne of grace;<br/>I find rest in Your presence, and fullness of joy.<br/>In worship and wonder I behold Your face,<br/>Singing what a faithful God have I.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>What a faithful God have I,<br/>What a faithful God.<br/>What a faithful God have I,<br/>Faithful in every way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord of mercy, You have heard my cry;<br/>Through the storm You're the beacon,<br/>My song in the night.<br/>In the shelter of Your wings,<br/>Hear my heart's reply,<br/>Singing what a faithful God have I.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lord all sov'reign, granting peace from heav'n,<br/>Let me comfort those who suffer<br/>With the comfort You have given.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I will tell of Your great love<br/>For as long as I live,<br/>Singing what a faithful God have I.</lines>
