    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>His heart was broken, mine was mended<br/>He became sin now I am clean<br/>The cross He carried bore my burden<br/>The nails that held Him set me free</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>His life for mine, His life for mine<br/>How could it ever be that He would die<br/>God's Son would die to save a wretch like me<br/>What love divine He gave His life for mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His scars of suffering brought me healing<br/>He spilled His blood to fill my soul<br/>His crown of thorns made me royalty<br/>His sorrow gave me joy untold</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He was despised and rejected<br/>Stripped of His garment and oppressed<br/>I am loved and accepted<br/>And I wear a robe of righteousness</lines>
    </verse>
