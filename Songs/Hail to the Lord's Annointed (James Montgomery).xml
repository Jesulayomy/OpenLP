    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hail to the Lord's anointed,<br/>Great David’s greater Son!<br/>Hail, in the time appointed,<br/>His reign on earth begun!<br/>He comes to break oppression,<br/>To set the captive free,<br/>To take away transgression,<br/>And rule in equity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He comes, with succour speedy,<br/>To those who suffer wrong;<br/>To help the poor and needy,<br/>And bid the weak be strong;<br/>To give them songs for sighing,<br/>Their darkness turn to light,<br/>Whose souls, condemned and dying,<br/>Were precious in His sight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He shall come down like showers<br/>Upon the fruitful earth;<br/>Love, joy and hope, like flowers,<br/>Spring in His path to birth;<br/>Before Him, on the mountains,<br/>Shall peace, the herald, go;<br/>And righteousness, in fountains,<br/>From hill to valley flow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Kings shall fall down before Him,<br/>And gold and incense bring;<br/>All nations shall adore Him,<br/>His praise all people sing;<br/>To Him shall prayer unceasing<br/>And daily vows ascend,<br/>His kingdom still increasing,<br/>A kingdom without end.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>O’er every foe victorious,<br/>He on His throne shall rest;<br/>From age to age more glorious,<br/>All-blessing and all-blessed.<br/>The tide of time shall never<br/>His covenant remove;<br/>His name shall stand forever,<br/>His changeless name of Love.</lines>
    </verse>
