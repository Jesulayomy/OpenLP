    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I stand upon the solid rock of faith in Christ<br/>This steadfast hope shall not break apart within the trial<br/>I am assured His promises will never fail<br/>As long as life remains, He is faithful</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>God is patient, God is kind<br/>He does not envy, He does not boast<br/>His ways are higher than my own<br/>His thoughts consume the great unknown<br/>Of this alone I am sure, my God is love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I draw my breath under His created windswept sky<br/>I know my hope shall last long after my flesh retires<br/>From dusk until the dawn He calls His children home<br/>His righteous love outlasts generations</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>He is Almighty God, Elohim<br/>Maker of the earth<br/>He is the Lord of hosts, heaven's King<br/>God of endless worth<br/>His kingdom stands above every power<br/>Every living soul<br/>His love is like the sun, ever true<br/>Shining over all</lines>
    </verse>
