    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The wind and waves surround me<br/>And I'm tossed, Feel like I'm drowning<br/>I am tired, I am weak<br/>I need you here with me<br/>'Cause I can feel the rising tide<br/>But I don't have the strength to fight<br/>I feel clouded and confused<br/>I need you here with me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In thechaos of the storm<br/>I have drifted far; far away<br/>But I call out your name<br/>'Cause you are just a breath<br/>A breath away</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Then through the shadows<br/>Your light appears<br/>I've known you're with me<br/>But now it is clear<br/>I can feel you<br/>Jesus All around</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Like sun on my skin<br/>Warm to the touch<br/>Here you surround me<br/>I am held by love<br/>I can feel you<br/>Jesus all around</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Now hope is rushing through my veins<br/>With everything you've rearranged<br/>I am peaceful; I am brave<br/>When you're here with me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>All my questions find their answers here<br/>When you come you change the atmosphere<br/>I am focused; I am clear<br/>When you're here with me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge:-<br/>There is nothing in this world<br/>That will satisfy my soul like you do (2)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Then through the shadows<br/>You're light appears<br/>I've known you're with me<br/>But now its is clear<br/>I can feel you<br/>Jesus all around<br/>Like sun on my skin<br/>Warm to the touch<br/>Here you surround me<br/>I am held by love<br/>I can feel you<br/>Jesus all around</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>Though the storm it rages<br/>I won't be moved<br/>I won't be shaken<br/>I'm anchored in you<br/>I can feel you<br/>Jesus all around</lines>
    </verse>
