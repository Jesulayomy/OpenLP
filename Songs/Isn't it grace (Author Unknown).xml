    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I think of all He left,<br/>and what he came to.<br/>I'm convinced that it's the greatest mystery.<br/>Just to think that Heaven's King would leave it all and<br/>come for one like me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Isn't it Amazing<br/>(Isn't It amazing that He'd come to where we are)<br/>Isn't it Amazing<br/>(Isn't it amazing that a King would go that far)<br/>Doesn't it Amaze you<br/>(Doesn't it amaze you that we'd find Him in this place)<br/>Ohh Isn't it Amazing Grace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>If I started writing now and wrote forever.<br/>I know that all my words would not convey.<br/>The depth of love so great that brings the spotless lamb to<br/>take my place.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Isn't it Amazing<br/>(Isn't It amazing that He'd come to where we are)<br/>Isn't it Amazing<br/>(Isn't it amazing that a King would go that far)<br/>Doesn't it Amaze you<br/>(Doesn't it amaze you that we'd find Him in this place)<br/>Ohh Isn't it Amazing Grace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For our sin and death he brought us life forever.<br/>For our broken lives he brought us perfect peace.<br/>From the shackles and the chain the King of Glory<br/>came to set us free.<br/>He Set Us Free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>Lord I want to Thank You<br/>(Lord I want to Thank You that you come to where we are)<br/>Lord I want to Thank You<br/>(Lord I want to Thank You that a King would go that far)<br/>Lord I want to Thank You<br/>(Lord I want to Thank You that we feel You in this place)<br/>Thank you Jesus for Amazing Grace</lines>
