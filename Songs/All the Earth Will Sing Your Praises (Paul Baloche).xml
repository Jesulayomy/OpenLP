      <lines>You lived, You died,<br/>You said in three days You would rise<br/>You did, You're alive<br/>You rule, You reign,<br/>You said You're coming back again<br/>I know You will<br/>and all the earth will sing Your praises</lines>

    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You took, You take our sins away oh God<br/>You give, You gave Your life away for us<br/>You came down, You saved us through the cross<br/>Our hearts are changed because of Your great love</lines>
