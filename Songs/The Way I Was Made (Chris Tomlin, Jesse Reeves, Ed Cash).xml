    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Caught in the half-light,<br/>I'm caught alone,<br/>Waking up to the sunrise<br/>and the radio.<br/>Feels like I'm tied up. What's holding me?<br/>Just praying today will be the day I go free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And I want to live<br/>like there's no tomorrow.<br/>I want to dance like no one's around.<br/>I want to sing like nobody's listening<br/>Before I lay my body down.<br/>I want to give like I have plenty.<br/>I want to love like I'm not afraid.<br/>I want to be the man<br/>I was meant to be.<br/>I want to be the way I was made.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Made in Your likeness.<br/>Made with Your hands.<br/>Made to discover who You are<br/>and who I am.<br/>All I've forgotten,<br/>help me to find.<br/>All that You've promised,<br/>let it be in my life.</lines>
    </verse>
