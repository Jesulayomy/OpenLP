    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>At the name of Jesus,<br/>Every knee shall bow,<br/>Every tongue confess Him<br/>King of glory now;<br/>’Tis the Father’s pleasure<br/>We should call Him Lord,<br/>Who from the beginning<br/>Was the mighty Word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Humbled for a season,<br/>To receive a name<br/>From the lips of sinners<br/>Unto whom He came;<br/>Faithfully He bore it<br/>Spotless to the last,<br/>Brought it back victorious,<br/>When from death He passed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Bore it up triumphant<br/>With its human light,<br/>Through all ranks of creatures<br/>To the central height,<br/>To the throne of Godhead,<br/>To the Father’s breast,<br/>Filled it with the glory<br/>Of that perfect rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>In your hearts enthrone Him;<br/>There let Him subdue<br/>All that is not holy,<br/>All that is not true;<br/>Crown Him as your Captain<br/>In temptation’s hour,<br/>Let His will enfold you<br/>In its light and power.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Brothers, this Lord Jesus<br/>Shall return again,<br/>With His Father’s glory,<br/>With His angel-train;<br/>For all wreaths of empire<br/>Meet upon His brow,<br/>And our hearts confess Him<br/>King of glory now.</lines>
