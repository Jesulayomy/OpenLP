    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Far dearer than all that<br/>The world can impart<br/>Was the message that came<br/>To my (To my heart)<br/>Now that Jesus alone <br/>For my sin did atone<br/>And calvary covers it all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The stripes that He bore and<br/>The thorns that He wore<br/>Told His mercy and love <br/>For evermore (For evermore)<br/>And my heart bowed in shame <br/>As I called on His name<br/>And calvary covers it all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Calvary covers it all<br/>My past with its sin and stain<br/>My guilt and despair<br/>Jesus took on Him there <br/>And calvary covers it all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>How matchless the grace <br/>When i looked in the face<br/>Of this Jesus my crucified<br/>Lord (Of my Lord)<br/>My redemption complete<br/>I then found at His feet<br/>And calvary covers it all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>How blessed the thought <br/>That my soul by him bought<br/>Shall be His in the glory <br/>On high (His on high)<br/>Where with gladness and song <br/>I'll be one of the throng<br/>And calvary covers it all</lines>
