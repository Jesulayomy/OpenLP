    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He counts the stars one and all<br/>He knows how much sand is on the shores<br/>He sees every sparrow that falls<br/>He made the mountains and the seas<br/>He's in control of everything<br/>Of all creatures great and small</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And He knows my name<br/>Every step that I take<br/>Every move that I make<br/>Every tear that I cry<br/>He knows my name<br/>When I'm overwhelmed by the pain<br/>And can't see the light of day<br/>I know I'll be just fine<br/>    Bb Eb Bb<br/>'Cause He knows my name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I don't know what tomorrow will bring<br/>I can't tell you what's in store<br/>I don't know a lot of things<br/>I don't have all the answers<br/>To the questions of life<br/>But I know in whom I have believed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>He knew who I was when He carried the cross<br/>He knew that I would fail Him but He took the loss</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>And He knows my name<br/>Every step that I take<br/>Every move that I make<br/>Every tear that I cry<br/>He knows my name<br/>When I'm overwhelmed by the pain<br/>And can't see the light of day<br/>I know I'll be just fine<br/>'Cause He knows my name</lines>
