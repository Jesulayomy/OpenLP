    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's still a mystery to me<br/>That the hands of God could be so small<br/>How tiny fingers reaching in the night<br/>Were the very hands that measured the sky</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Hallelujah, hallelujah<br/>Heaven's love reaching down to save the world<br/>Hallelujah, hallelujah, son of God, servant King<br/>Here with us, You're here with us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It's still a mystery to me<br/>How His infant eyes have seen the dawn of time<br/>How His ears have heard an angel's symphony<br/>But still Mary had to rock her Savior to sleep</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus, the Christ, born in Bethlehem<br/>A baby born to save, to save the souls of man</lines>
