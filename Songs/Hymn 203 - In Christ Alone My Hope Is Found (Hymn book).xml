    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In Christ alone my hope is found <br/>He is my light, my strength, my song<br/>This cornerstone, this solid ground<br/>Firm through the fiercer drought and storm<br/>What heights of love, what depths of peace <br/>When fears are stilled, when strivings cease<br/>My comforter, my all in all<br/>Here in the love of Christ I stand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In Christ alone, who took on flesh<br/>Fullness of God in helpless babe<br/>This gift of love and righteousness<br/>Scorned by the ones he came to save<br/>"Til on the cross as Jesus died<br/>The wrath of God was satisfied<br/>For every sin on him was laid<br/>Here in the death of christ I live,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There in the ground, his body lay<br/>Light of the world by darkness slain<br/>Then bursting forth in glorious day<br/>Up from the grave he rose again<br/>And as he stands in victory<br/>Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me<br/>For I am his and he is mine<br/>Bought with the precious blood of Christ</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>No guilt in life, no fear in death<br/>This is the power of Christ in me<br/>From life's first cry to final breath<br/>Jesus commands my destiny<br/>No power of hell<br/>No scheme of man<br/>Can ever pluck me <br/>From his hand<br/>Till he returns<br/>Or call me home<br/>Here in the power of Christ I stand.</lines>
