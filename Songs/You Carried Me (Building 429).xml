    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've been so busy, I missed the reasons<br/>I missed your love, I nearly missed it all<br/>Still you've loved me, And you've healed me<br/>You've given all and it brought me to your cross</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>I stand only because<br/>You've given me grace to walk<br/>Only because</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>You've carried me<br/>You carried me<br/>You carried me through it all<br/>And I believe<br/>Yes, I believe<br/>You'll carry me<br/>All the way home<br/>Mercy covers all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I know the scripture<br/>I've known the songs<br/>I sang the words<br/>From my hollowed Heart<br/>You've spoken softly<br/>Through the storm<br/>I've heard your voice<br/>And felt the calm</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p2">
      <lines>I stand only because<br/>You've given me faith to walk</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I know that you love me<br/>I'll never doubt it I can't live without it<br/>Your mercy has found me<br/>I'll never doubt it I can't live without it</lines>
    </verse>
