    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He set you free<br/>So you could see<br/>How much He loves you<br/>Just take a look<br/>It's in His book<br/>How much He loves you<br/>His Word reveals<br/>All that He feels<br/>He spelled it out<br/>Never a doubt</lines>

      <lines>He loves you<br/>Just because He loves you<br/>Just because He loves you<br/>He loves you<br/>Just because He loves you<br/>Just because He loves you<br/>There's nothing you can do to<br/>make Him love you more<br/>There's nothing you can do to<br/>make Him love you less<br/>He loves you<br/>Just because He loves you<br/>Just because He loves you</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Once we were lost<br/>Needing the cross<br/>Needing a Savior<br/>He came to earth<br/>A humble birth<br/>Born in a manger<br/>His words were truth<br/>His life was proof<br/>He was God's Son<br/>Sent for each one</lines>
