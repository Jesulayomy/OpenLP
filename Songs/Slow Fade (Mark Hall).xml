    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Be careful little eyes what you see;<br/>It's the second glance that ties your hands as darkness pulls the strings.<br/>Be careful little feet where you go,<br/>For it's the little feet behind you that are sure to follow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>It's a slow fade when you give yourself away.<br/>It's a slow fade when black and white have turned to gray.<br/>Thoughts invade, choices are made, a price will be paid<br/>When you give yourself away.<br/>People never crumble in a day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>It's a slow fade, it's a slow fade.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Be careful little ears what you hear;<br/>When flattery leads to compromise, the end is always near.<br/>Be careful little lips what you say,<br/>For empty words and promises lead broken hearts astray.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b2">
      <lines>The journey from your mind to your hands<br/>Is shorter than you're thinking.<br/>Be careful if you think you stand;<br/>You just might be sinking.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b3">
      <lines>Daddies never crumble in a day.<br/>Families never crumble in a day.<br/>Oh be careful little eyes what you see,<br/>Oh be careful little eyes what you see,<br/>For the Father up above is looking down in love.<br/>Oh be careful little eyes what you see.</lines>
