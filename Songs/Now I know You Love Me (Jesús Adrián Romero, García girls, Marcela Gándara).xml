    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>From the beginning when I first needed You<br/>and in that moment when I turned my eyes to You<br/>and on that day when I felt so all alone<br/>I could feel Your eyes looking down on me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Now, I know You love me, I can see<br/>You saw so much more that I could be<br/>You waited all that time, patiently<br/>Now, I know You love me, when I would flee<br/>far from Your arms, reaching for me<br/>With Your Grace and with Your love<br/>Your forgiveness from above<br/>I am here</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>From far away I could feel Your presence near<br/>I knew You cared and Your voice I could hear<br/>and in the silence I could hear You calling me<br/>every day I felt Your love drawing me</lines>
    </verse>
