      <lines>Show us, more miracles, i-f yo-u are Messiah<br/>Give us, free bread each day.<br/>Just like, our father said, as<br/>He jour-neyed through the wilderness<br/>But this is, what Jesus had to say</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I am, I am the bread of life<br/>You will never grow hungry<br/>I am your water, drink and never thirst again<br/>I am, I am your father; Child, I know you by name<br/>I am, and I'll never change</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He's the Alpha, and Omega<br/>The beginning, and the end<br/>He'is the same, as He wa-s back then<br/>And just like, He raised the dead<br/>And caused the blind to see<br/>He'-ll work mira-cles, if we'll just believe.</lines>
