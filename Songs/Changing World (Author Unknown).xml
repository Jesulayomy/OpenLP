    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I thought I had it all under control<br/>I thought my fate was still in my hands<br/>All of my plans were firmly set<br/>By the words that I say</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>I forgot how quickly things can change<br/>Now my vision can not be the same</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>My life is not what I thought<br/>I'm not where I planned to be<br/>Though something's gone<br/>There's nothing wrong with my changing world<br/>Though something's gone<br/>There's nothing wrong with my changing world</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I need to let go of my destiny<br/>I need to trust in things unseen<br/>I believe in having faith<br/>Though I yield my control</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I'm embracing all of my fears<br/>I am watching them turn to delight<br/>The very fears which were gripping my mind<br/>Are now the hands shaping and sculpting my dreams</lines>
