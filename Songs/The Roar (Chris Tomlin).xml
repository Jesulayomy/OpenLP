    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse1:<br/>I waited for the Lord<br/>He turned and heard my cry<br/>His mercy opened up my eyes<br/>When I couldn't see and my strength was failing me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>I heard the roar of the lion of Judah<br/>I heard the voice that calms the raging sea<br/>He came to me, came to me<br/>When I needed the Lord<br/>I heard the roar of the lion of Judah</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse 2:<br/>I waited for the Lord<br/>He appeared in blinding light<br/>He led me through the darkest night<br/>When I couldn't see and my strength was failing me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>I lifted my hands<br/>He lifted me out<br/>All praise to the Savior, all worship to God<br/>With all that I am<br/>With all in my heart<br/>All praise to the Savior, all worship to God</lines>
    </verse>
