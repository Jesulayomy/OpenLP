    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>All of You is more than enough for all of me,<br/>For every thirst and every need.<br/>You satisfy me with Your love,<br/>And all I have in You is more than enough.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You are my supply, my breath of life,<br/>Still more awesome than I know;<br/>You are my reward, worth living for,<br/>Still more awesome than I know!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You're my sacrifice, of greatest price,<br/>Still more awesome than I know;<br/>You're my coming King, You are everything,<br/>Still more awesome than I know!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>More than all I want,<br/>More than all I need,<br/>You are more than enough for me.<br/>More than all I know,<br/>More than all I can see,<br/>You are more than enough for...</lines>
