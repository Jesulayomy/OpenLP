  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I was held up in chains<br/>The river was free.<br/>When I was covered in stains<br/>The river was clean.<br/>When I was losing my way<br/>The river found me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I can see the river.<br/>I can feel the river.<br/>I'm letting go of all I hold onto.<br/>Let it wash away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When we were broken inside<br/>The river was love.<br/>When we were thirsty and dry<br/>You were more than enough.<br/>When we were drowning in lies<br/>The river saved us.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>I'm dancing in the river.<br/>And I'll be here forever.<br/>I'm letting go of everything but You.<br/>Carry me away.<br/>Carry me away.<br/>Carry me away.<br/>Carry me away.<br/>Carry me away.<br/>Carry me away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>And I can see the river!<br/>It's washin' me away.<br/>My life is in the river.<br/>And I'll be here forever.<br/>I'm lettin' go of all that I hold onto.<br/>Can you see the river?<br/>When you're standin' in the river,<br/>Letting go of everything,<br/>Everything but You.</lines>
