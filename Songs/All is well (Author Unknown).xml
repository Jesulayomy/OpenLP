    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>CHORUS<br/>All is well, all is well.<br/>I have heard the message "Shalom"<br/>and all is well.<br/>There is a place of perfect rest<br/>inside the inner veil.<br/>So rest, little Bride, rest,<br/>for all is well.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now things have not worked out<br/>like God's people thought.<br/>For we're still here, to fight the<br/>greatest battle ever fought.<br/>We must have the faith of Abraham,<br/>knowing God's Word never fails.<br/>If you trust in Him you will find<br/>that - All is well! -</lines>
