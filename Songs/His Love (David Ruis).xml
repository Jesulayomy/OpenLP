    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>His love is higher than the highest of mountains.<br/>His love goes deeper than the deepest of seas.<br/>His love, it stretches to the farthest horizon,<br/>And His love, it reaches to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His love is stronger than the angels and demons.<br/>His love, it keeps me in my life's darkest hour.<br/>His love secures me on the pathway to heaven,<br/>And His love is my strength and power.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His love is sweeter than the sweetest of honey.<br/>His love is better than the choicest of wine.<br/>His love, it satisfies the deepest of hunger,<br/>And His love in Jesus, it's mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Your love is sweeter than the sweetest of honey.<br/>Your love is better than the choicest of wine.<br/>Your love, it satisfies the deepest of hunger,<br/>And Your love in Jesus, it's mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Your love is stronger than the angels and demons.<br/>Your love, it keeps me in my life's darkest hour.<br/>Your love secures me on the pathway to heaven,<br/>And Your love is my strength and power.</lines>
