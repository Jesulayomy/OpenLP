    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There are two roads you may take<br/>One by sight, one by faith<br/>Take the Word of God or what you see,<br/>What you believe is what will be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Set your wings to the winds of faith<br/>You can fly in a higher place.<br/>Do not struggle, it's by grace.<br/>Set your wings to the winds of faith</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>What's your need, what's your cry,<br/>What's your mountain much too high.<br/>Speak the Word of God, and by and by,<br/>It will move or you will fly.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Watch the eagle in the sky,<br/>He does not struggle, he does not strive.<br/>For the power that makes him rise,<br/>is already in the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
