      <lines>So let me stand up and sing of His goodness<br/>Let me lift up a song in your place<br/>Cause I know that He'll always be with us<br/>Even when we can't see His face<br/>I'm gonna sing to the One who is faithful</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Though the battle is not over yet<br/>And I'll be your voice till you're able<br/>And I'll lift up your hands when you can't</lines>
