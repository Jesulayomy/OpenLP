    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We have nothing to get that didn't first come from your hand<br/>We have nothing to offer you which you did not provide<br/>Every good perfect gift comes from your kind and gracious heart<br/>And all we do is give back to you what always has been yours</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Lord we're breathing the breath that you gave us to breath<br/>To worship you, to worship you<br/>And we're singing these songs with the very same breath<br/>To worship you, to worship you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who has given to you that it should be paid back to him?<br/>Who has given to you as if you needed anything?<br/>From you and to you and through you come all things oh Lord<br/>And all we do is give back to you what always has been yours</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>We are breathing the breath that you gave us to breath<br/>We are breathing the breath that you gave us to breath</lines>
