    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I used to think that I could walk on this road alone<br/>That I had the strength- mmmm- to carry on<br/>And I could be somebody if I really tried<br/>The power that I needed was hidden inside</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>But then I saw myself for who I really was.<br/>I saw my emptiness- I saw I needed help<br/>But then I saw myself for I was really was</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>But now that I'm with you my life is beautiful<br/>And now that I'm with you my life is so wonderful<br/>You've given me the strength I need to carry on<br/>In the hard times and low times<br/>With you my God I'll get through</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I used to live my life just to seize the day<br/>Do everything I could to be self-made<br/>And pride was all I needed, no one else around<br/>My happiness and joy was what I thought I found</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p2">

      <lines>But now that I'm with you my life is beautiful<br/>And now that I'm with you my life is so wonderful<br/>You've given me the strength I need to carry on<br/>In the hard times and low times<br/>With you my God I'll get through</lines>

    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I've been created for you Lord<br/>I've been put here by your Word<br/>I'm nothing, without You<br/>Without Your love I can't go on<br/>By Your touch my life was born<br/>You knew me all along</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p3">
      <lines>And now I see myself For who I'm meant to be<br/>A child of God I am In your hands I'll be<br/>And now I see myself For who I'm meant to be</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>But now that I'm with you my life is beautiful<br/>And now that I'm with you my life is so wonderful<br/>You've given me the strength I need to carry on<br/>In the hard times and low times<br/>With you my God I'll get through</lines>
