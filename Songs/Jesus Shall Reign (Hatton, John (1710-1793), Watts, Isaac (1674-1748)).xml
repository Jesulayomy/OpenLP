    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus shall reign where'er the sun Does his successive journeys run; His kingdom stretch from shore to shore Till moons shall wax and wane no more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For Him shall endless prayer be made, And praises throng to crown His head; His Name, like sweet perfume shall rise With every morning sacrifice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>People and realms of every tongue Dwell on His love with sweetest song; And infant voices shall proclaim Their early blessings on His Name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Blessings abound where'er He reigns; The prisoner leaps to lose his chains, The weary find eternal rest, And all the sons of want are blest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Where He displays His healing power Death and the curse are known no more; In Him the tribes of Adam boast More blessings than their father lost.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Let every creature rise and bring<br/>Peculiar honors to our King,<br/>Angels descend with songs again,<br/>And earth repeat the loud Amen.</lines>
    </verse>
