  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>These are the days of Elijah,<br/>Declaring the word of the Lord,<br/>And these are the days of Your servant, Moses,<br/>Righteousness being restored.<br/>And though these are the days of great trials,<br/>Of famine and darkness and sword,<br/>Still, we are the voice in the desert crying,<br/>"Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Behold He comes, riding on the clouds,<br/>Shining like the sun at the trumpet call.<br/>So lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,<br/>And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And these are the days of Ezekiel,<br/>The dry bones becoming as flesh.<br/>And these are the days of Your servant, David,<br/>Rebuilding the temple of praise.<br/>And these are the days of the harvest,<br/>The fields are as white in the world.<br/>And we are the laborers in Your vineyard,<br/>Declaring the word of the Lord!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>There's no one like Jehovah, there's no one like Jehovah,<br/>There's no one like Jehovah, there's no one like Jehovah.</lines>
