    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Church's one foundation Is Jesus Christ her Lord, She is His new creation By water and the Word. From heav'n He came and sought her To be His holy bride; With His own blood He bought her And for her life He died.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>She is from every nation, Yet one o'er all the earth; Her charter of salvation, One Lord, one faith, one birth; One holy Name she blesses, Partakes one holy food, And to one hope she presses, With every grace endued.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Church shall never perish! Her dear Lord to defend, To guide, sustain, and cherish, Is with her to the end: Though there be those who hate her, And false sons in her pale, Against or foe or traitor She ever shall prevail.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Though with a scornful wonder Men see her sore oppressed, By schisms rent asunder, By heresies distressed: Yet saints their watch are keeping, Their cry goes up, 'How long?' And soon the night of weeping Shall be the morn of song!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>'Mid toil and tribulation, And tumult of her war, She waits the consummation Of peace forevermore; Till, with the vision glorious, Her longing eyes are blest, And the great Church victorious Shall be the Church at rest.</lines>
    </verse>
