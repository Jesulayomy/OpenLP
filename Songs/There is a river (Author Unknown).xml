    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is a river<br/>that flows from deep within.<br/>There is a fountain<br/>that frees my soul from sin.<br/>Come to this water,<br/>there is a vast supply.<br/>There is a river<br/>that never shall run dry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There was a thirsty woman,<br/>Who was drawing from a well,<br/>Her life was ruined and wasted,<br/>Her soul was bound for hell.<br/>Then she met the Master,<br/>Who told of her great sin,<br/>He said, "If you drink this water,<br/>You'll never thirst again."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There came a sound from Heaven<br/>As a rushing, mighty wind,<br/>It filled their hearts with singing,<br/>And gave them peace within.<br/>The prophet gave the promise,<br/>The Spirit will descend,<br/>And from your inner being,<br/>A river with no end.</lines>
    </verse>
