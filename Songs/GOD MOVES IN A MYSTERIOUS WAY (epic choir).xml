    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>God moves in a mysterious way<br/>His wonders to perform <br/>He plants His footsteps in the sea<br/>And rides upon the storm</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>Deep in unfathomable mines of <br/>Never failing Skill<br/>He treasures up His bright Designs <br/>And works His sovereign will<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1c">
      <lines>Ye fearful saints, fresh coverage Take<br/>The clouds ye so much dread<br/>Are big with mercy, and shall Break<br/>In blessings on your head</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1d">
      <lines>Judge not the Lord by feeble sense<br/>But trust Him for His grace<br/>Behind a forwarding providence<br/>He hides a smiling face</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1e">
      <lines>His purposes will ripen fast<br/>Unfolding every hour<br/>The bud may have a bitter taste<br/>But sweet will be the flower</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1f">
      <lines>Blind unbelief is sure to err<br/>And scan His work in vain<br/>God is His own interpreter<br/>And He will make it plain.</lines>
    </verse>
