    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In my heart, in my heart,<br/>there's a fire burning,<br/>A passion deep within my soul,<br/>not slowing down not growing cold.<br/>An unquenchable flame<br/>that keeps burning brighter,<br/>A love that's blazing like the sun<br/>for who You are and what You've done.<br/>And as the fire is raging on,<br/>So Your praise becomes my song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>The whole earth is filled<br/>with Your glory, Lord.<br/>Angels and men adore;<br/>Creation longs for what's in store.<br/>May You be honored and glorified,<br/>exalted and lifted high.<br/>Here at Your feet I lay my life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>From the ends of the earth<br/>to the heights of heaven,<br/>Your glory, Lord, is far and wide;<br/>through history You reign on high.<br/>From the depths of the sea<br/>to the mountain's summit,<br/>Your power, Lord, it knows no bounds;<br/>a higher love cannot be found.<br/>So let the universe proclaim<br/>Your great power and Your great name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>The whole earth is filled<br/>with Your glory, Lord.<br/>Mountains bow and oceans roar;<br/>Creation longs for what's in store.<br/>May You be honored and glorified,<br/>exalted and lifted high.<br/>Here at Your feet I lay my life.</lines>
