    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When Jesus comes to reward His servants <br/>Whether it be noon or night <br/>Faithful to Him will He find us watching <br/>With our lamps all trimmed and bright</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh can we say we are ready, brother <br/>Ready for the soul's bright home?<br/>Say, will He find you and me still watching <br/>Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>If at the dawn of the early morning <br/>He shall call us one by one <br/>When to the Lord we restore our talents <br/>Will He answer thee well done? <br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Have we been true to the trust He left us <br/>Do we seek to do our best? <br/>If in our hearts there is naught condemn us <br/>We shall have a glorious rest</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching <br/>In his glory they shall share <br/>If He shall come at the dawn or midnight <br/>Will He find us watching there?</lines>
