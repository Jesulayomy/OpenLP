    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'm but a stranger here, Heav'n is my home; Earth is a desert drear, Heav'n is my home. Danger and sorrow stand round me on every hand; Heav'n is my fatherland, Heav'n is my home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>What though the tempest rage, Heav'n is my home; Short is my pilgrimage, Heav'n is my home; Time's wild and wintry blast soon shall be over past; I shall reach home at last, Heav'n is my home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There at my Savior's side Heav'n is my home; I shall be glorified, Heav'n is my home. There are the good and blest, those I loved most and best; There, too, I soon shall rest, Heav'n is my home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Therefore I murmur not, Heav'n is my home; Whate'er my earthly lot, Heav'n is my home; And I shall surely stand there at my Lord's right hand. Heav'n is my fatherland, Heav'n is my home.</lines>
