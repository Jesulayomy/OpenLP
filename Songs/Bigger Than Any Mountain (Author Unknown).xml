    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Bigger than all the shadows that fall across my path,<br/>God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see.<br/>He's bigger than all the confusion, bigger than anything;<br/>God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus<br/>He's bigger than all my problems, bigger than all my fears;<br/>God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see.<br/>Oh, yes, he's bigger than all my questions, bigger than anything;<br/>God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He's bigger than all the giants of pain and unbelief;<br/>God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see.<br/>He's bigger than any discouragement, bigger than anything;<br/>My God is bigger than any mountain that I can or can not see</lines>
