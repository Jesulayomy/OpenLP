    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Letting go of every single dream I lay each one down at your feet<br/>Every moment of my wandering Never changes what you see<br/>I've tried to win this war I confess My hands are weary I need your rest<br/>Mighty warrior king of the fight No matter what I face you're by my side</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>When you don't move the mountains I'm needing you to move<br/>When you don't part the waters I wish I could walk through<br/>When you don't give the answers as I cry out to you<br/>I will trust I will trust I will trust in you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Truth is you know what tomorrow brings There's not a day ahead you have not seen<br/>So in all things be my life and breath I want what you want lord and nothing less</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>When you don't move the mountains I'm needing you to move<br/>When you don't part the waters I wish I could walk through<br/>When you don't give the answers as I cry out to you<br/>I will trust I will trust I will trust in you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You are my strength and comfort You are my steady hand<br/>You are my firm foundation The rock on which I stand<br/>Your ways are always higher Your plans are always good<br/>There's not a place where I'll go you've not already stood</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>When you don't move the mountains I'm needing you to move<br/>When you don't part the waters I wish I could walk through<br/>When you don't give the answers as I cry out to you<br/>I will trust I will trust I will trust in you</lines>
