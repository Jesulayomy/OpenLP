    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Why me, Lord what have I ever done<br/>To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known<br/>Tell me, Lord what did I ever do<br/>That was worth loving You or the kindness You've shown</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Lord, help me, Jesus i've wasted it so<br/>Help me, Jesus i know what I am<br/>Now that I know that I've needed You<br/>So help me, Jesus my soul's in Your hands</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Try me, Lord if You think there's a way<br/>I could ever repay all I've taken from You<br/>Maybe, Lord I can show someone else<br/>What I've been through myself on my way back to You</lines>
