      <lines>Our call to war, to love the captive soul<br/>But to rage against the captor<br/>And with the sword that makes the wounded whole<br/>We will fight with faith and valourWhen faced with trials on every side<br/>We know the outcome is secure<br/>And Christ will have the prize for which He died<br/>An inheritance of nations</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Come, see the cross where love and mercy meet<br/>As the Son of God is stricken<br/>And see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet<br/>For the Conqueror has risen<br/>And as the stone is rolled away<br/>And Christ emerges from the grave<br/>This victory march continues 'til the day<br/>Every eye and heart shall see Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So Spirit, come put strength in every stride<br/>Give grace for every hurdle<br/>That we may run with faith to win the prize<br/>Of a servant good and faithful<br/>As saints of old still line the way<br/>Retelling triumphs of His grace<br/>We hear their call and hunger for the day<br/>When with Christ we stand in glory</lines>
