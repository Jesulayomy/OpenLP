    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>// Let everything that, everything that,<br/>Everything that has breath,<br/>Praise the Lord.  //</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise You in the morning,<br/>Praise You in the evening,<br/>Praise You when I'm young and when I'm old.<br/>Praise You when I'm laughing,<br/>Praise You when I'm grieving,<br/>Praise You every season of the soul.<br/>If we could see how much You're worth,<br/>Your power, Your might, Your endless love,<br/>Then surely we would never cease to praise:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Praise You in the heavens.<br/>Joining with the angels,<br/>Praising You forever and a day.<br/>Praise You on the earth now,<br/>Joining with creation,<br/>Calling all the nations to Your praise.<br/>If they could see how much You're worth,<br/>Your power, Your might, Your endless love,<br/>Then surely we would never cease to praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>And I will worship, I will worship,<br/>I will worship you with every breath</lines>
