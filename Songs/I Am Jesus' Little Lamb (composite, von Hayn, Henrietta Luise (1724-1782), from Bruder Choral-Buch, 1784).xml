    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I am Jesus' little lamb, Ever glad at heart I am; For my Shepherd gently guides me, Knows my need, and well provides me, Loves me ev'ry day the same, Even calls me by my name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Day by day, at home, away, Jesus is my Staff and Stay. When I hunger, Jesus feeds me, Into pleasant pastures leads me; When I thirst, He bids me go Where the quiet waters flow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who so happy as I am, Even now the Shepherd's lamb? And when my short life is ended, By His angel host attended, He shall fold me to His breast, There within His arms to rest.</lines>
    </verse>
