    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As David did in Jehovah's sight,<br/>I will dance will all my might<br/>Before the King of Kings<br/>As Miriam did with the tambourine,<br/>I will clap my hands and sing<br/>before the King of Kings.<br/>As Judah did on the battle ground,<br/>we will make a joyful sound<br/>before the King of Kings.<br/>As Joshua did at Jericho,<br/>we will shout to defeat the foe<br/>before the King of Kings</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We can come before Him,<br/>and worship Him today!<br/>We can now adore Him,<br/>Yeshua, You made the way!</lines>
