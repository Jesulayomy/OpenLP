  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who am I, that the<br/>Lord of all the earth<br/>Would care to know my name, would care to feel my hurt?<br/>Who am I, that the<br/>Bright and Morning Star<br/>Would choose to light the way, for my ever-wandering heart?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>Not because of who I am, but because of what You've done.<br/>Not because of what I've done, but because of who You are.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I am a flower quickly fading, here today and gone tomorrow,<br/>A wave tossed in the ocean, a vapor in the wind.<br/>Still You hear me when I'm calling.<br/>Lord, You catch me when I'm falling.<br/>And You've told me who I am: I am Yours. I am Yours.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who am I, that the<br/>eyes that see my sin<br/>Would look on me with love, and watch me rise again?<br/>Who am I, that the<br/>voice that calmed the sea<br/>Would call out through the rain, and calm the storm in me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>I am a flower quickly fading, here today and gone tomorrow,<br/>A wave tossed in the ocean, a vapor in the wind.<br/>Still You hear me when I'm calling.<br/>Lord, You catch me when I'm falling.<br/>And You've told me who I am: I am Yours.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I am Yours.<br/>Whom shall I fear, whom shall I fear?<br/>Cause I am Yours, I am Yours.</lines>
