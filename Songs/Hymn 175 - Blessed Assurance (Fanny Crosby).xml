    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine:<br/>O what a foretaste of glory divine!<br/>Heir of salvation, purchase of God;<br/>Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>This is my story, this is my song,<br/>Praising my Saviour all the day long.<br/>This is my story, this is my song,<br/>Praising my Saviour all the day long.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Perfect submission, perfect delight,<br/>Visions of rapture burst on my sight;<br/>Angels descending bring from above<br/>Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Perfect submission, all is at rest,<br/>I in my Saviour am happy and blessed;<br/>Watching and waiting, looking above,<br/>Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.</lines>
    </verse>
