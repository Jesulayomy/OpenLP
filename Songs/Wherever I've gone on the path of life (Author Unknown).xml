    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Wherever I've gone on the path of life<br/>No matter how much fear I've met<br/>I always felt beside me<br/>The gracious hand of my Savior<br/>And even if I got tired along the way<br/>You always gently lifted me up<br/>And gave me hope again</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>You are always with me, You are always with me,<br/>I firmly know that always<br/>Your hand is with me You are with me.<br/>Let it be dark around me<br/>But in my soul it is light because I know, I believe<br/>that you are always with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>If the darkness gathered round me<br/>Or my friends walked away<br/>I was not afraid, for with You<br/>I walked through this stormy life<br/>And whatever happens in my life<br/>I'm ready to sing, not cry<br/>I'm already lifted up from this thought:<br/>You can warm my heart.</lines>
