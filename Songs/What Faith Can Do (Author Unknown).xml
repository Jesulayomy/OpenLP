    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Everybody falls sometimes<br/>Gotta find the strength to rise<br/>From the ashes and make a new beginning<br/>Anyone can feel the ache<br/>You think it's more than you can take<br/>But you are stronger, stronger than you know</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>Don't you give up now the sun will soon be shining<br/>You gotta face the clouds to find the silver lining</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I've seen dreams that move the mountains<br/>Hope that doesn't ever end<br/>Even when the sky is falling<br/>And I've seen miracles just happen<br/>Silent prayers get answered<br/>Broken hearts become brand new<br/>That's what faith can do</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It doesn't matter what you've heard<br/>Impossible is not a word<br/>It's just a reason for someone not to try<br/>Everybody's scared to death<br/>When they decide to take that step<br/>Out on the water it'll be alright</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p2">
      <lines>Life is so much more than what your eyes are seeing<br/>You will find your way if you keep believing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>I've seen dreams that move the mountains<br/>Hope that doesn't ever end<br/>Even when the sky is falling<br/>And I've seen miracles just happen<br/>Silent prayers get answered<br/>Broken hearts become brand new<br/>That's what faith can do</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>You don't have a chance<br/>(That's what faith can do)<br/>When the world says you can't<br/>It'll tell you that you can!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>I've seen dreams that move the mountains<br/>Hope that doesn't ever end<br/>Even when the sky is falling<br/>And I've seen miracles just happen<br/>Silent prayers get answered<br/>Broken hearts become brand new<br/>That's what faith can do<br/>That's what faith can do!<br/>Even if you fall sometimes<br/>You will have the strength to rise</lines>
