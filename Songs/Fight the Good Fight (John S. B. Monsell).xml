      <lines>Fight the good fight with all thy might,<br/>Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right;<br/>Lay hold on life, and it shall be<br/>Thy joy and crown eternally.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Run the straight race through Godâ€™s good grace,<br/>Lift up thine eyes and seek His face;<br/>Life with its way before thee lies,<br/>Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide;<br/>His boundless mercy will provide;<br/>Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove<br/>Christ is its life, and Christ its love.<br/>Faint not, nor fear, His arms are near,<br/>He changeth not, and thou art dear;<br/>Only believe, and thou shalt see<br/>That Christ is all in all to thee.</lines>
