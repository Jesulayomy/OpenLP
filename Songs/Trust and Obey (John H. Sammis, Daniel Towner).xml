    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word, What a glory He sheds on our way!<br/>Let us do His good will, He abides with us still,<br/>And with all who will trust and obey.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Trust and obey, for there's no other way<br/>To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,<br/>But our toil He doth richly repay;<br/>Not a grief or a loss, not a frown or a cross,<br/>But is blessed if we trust and obey.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet.<br/>Or we'll walk by His side in the way.<br/>What He says we will do, where He sends we will go;<br/>Never fear, only trust and obey.</lines>
    </verse>
