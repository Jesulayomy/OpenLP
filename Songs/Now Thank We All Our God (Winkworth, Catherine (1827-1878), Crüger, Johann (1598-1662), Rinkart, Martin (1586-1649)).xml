    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Now thank we all our God, with heart and hands and voices, Who wondrous things has done, in Whom this world rejoices; Who from our mothers' arms has blessed us on our way With countless gifts of love, and still is ours today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O may this bounteous God through all our life be near us, With ever joyful hearts and blessed peace to cheer us; And keep us in His grace, and guide us when perplexed; And free us from all ills, in this world and the next!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>All praise and thanks to God the Father now be given; The Son and Him Who reigns with Them in highest Heaven; The one eternal God, Whom earth and Heav'n adore; For thus it was, is now, and shall be evermore.</lines>
