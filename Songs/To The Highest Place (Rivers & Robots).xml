    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lyrics:<br/>Before the earth was made You were living<br/>And over every heart You've been singing<br/>Your very word spoke life into being<br/>You even give the breath we are breathing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And now, we sing our songs back to You<br/>Oh Lord, we gladly lay down our lives at Your feet<br/>We take the breath You gave<br/>And we give it back in praise<br/>You are exalted to the highest place<br/>You have the name above all other names</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Stepping down into a world You made<br/>The uncreated God in a human frame<br/>Creator dwelling with creation<br/>You made Yourself of no reputation</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And You made Yourself nothing for us<br/>And You gave up Your life for the least of men<br/>You entered the gates of death<br/>But rose with the keys in Your hands</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>There is no one like You, There is none besides You</lines>
