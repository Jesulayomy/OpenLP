    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Left my fear by the side of the road<br/>Hear You speak<br/>Won't let go<br/>Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray<br/>Got every reason to be here again<br/>Father's heart that pulls me in<br/>And all my eyes want to see is a glimpse of You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>All I need is You<br/>All I need is You Lord<br/>Is you Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>One more day and it's not the same<br/>Your spirit calls my heart to sing<br/>Drawn to the voice of my Savior once again<br/>Where would my soul be without Your Son<br/>Gave His life to save the earth<br/>Rest in the thought that You're watching over me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>You hold the universe<br/>You hold everyone on earth<br/>You hold the universe<br/>You hold<br/>You hold</lines>
