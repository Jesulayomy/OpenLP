    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Soon and very soon we are going to see the king<br/>Hallelujah, hallelujah, we're going to see the king</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>No more crying there, we are going to see the king<br/>Hallelujah, hallelujah, we're going to see the king</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Should there be any rivers we must cross<br/>Should there be any mountains we must climb<br/>God will supply all the strength that we need<br/>Give us strength till we reach the other side.<br/>We have come from every nation,<br/>God has already signed our name.<br/>Jesus took his blood and he washed my sins, he washed them all away.<br/>Yet there are those of us who have laid down our lives<br/>But we all shall meet again on the other side.<br/>Back to the chorus<br/>Should there be any rivers we must cross<br/>Should there be any mountains we must climb<br/>God will supply all the strength that we need<br/>Give us strength till we reach the other side.</lines>
