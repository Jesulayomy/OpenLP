    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All rise, all fall.<br/>I'll fail you all.<br/>We built these cities to stand so tall.<br/>We've lost our walls.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>I don't want to lose you, coming down,<br/>With the whole world upside-down.<br/>I don't have a soul to trust in now,<br/>With the whole world upside-down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>We are one, tonight!<br/>And we're singing it out!<br/>We are one, tonight!<br/>And we're dreaming out loud!<br/>Though the world is flawed,<br/>These scars will heal.<br/>We are one, tonight!<br/>Tonight!<br/>Tonight!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Two eyes, one tongue.<br/>I've come undone.<br/>I'm no victim, I've paid these dues.<br/>I came to lose.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p2">
      <lines>I don't want to fight about it now,<br/>With the whole world upside-down.<br/>I don't have a soul to trust in, now,<br/>With the whole world upside-down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I don't want to lose the common ground,<br/>With the whole world upside-down.<br/>I don't want to fight about it now,<br/>In a world that's burning out.<br/>Let's slow the evening down.<br/>Slow it down.<br/>Slow down.<br/>Please slow down,<br/>Down, down.<br/>The stars are comin' out!</lines>
