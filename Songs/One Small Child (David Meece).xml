    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>One small Child in a land of a thousand,<br/>One small dream of a Savior tonight,<br/>One small hand reaching out to the star light,<br/>One small city of life. Ooohhh.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>One king bringing his gold and riches,<br/>One king ruling an army of might,<br/>One king kneeling with incense and candle light,<br/>One King brining us life. Ooohhh.<br/>See Him lying, a cradle beneath Him; See Him smiling in the stall.<br/>See His mother praising His Father; See His tiny eyelids fall.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>One small light from the flame of a candle,<br/>One small light from a city of might,<br/>One small light from the stars in the endless night,<br/>One small light from a face. Ooohhh.<br/>See the shepherds kneeling before Him; See the kings on bending knee.<br/>See His mother praising His Father; See the Blessed Infant sleep.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>One small Child in a land of a thousand,<br/>One small dream in a people of might,<br/>One small hand reaching out to the star light,<br/>One small Savior of life. Ooohhh.</lines>
