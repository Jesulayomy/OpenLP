    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>[Verse 1]<br/>In the front lines, You fight for me<br/>Oh, Your kindness is my shield<br/>When the armies rise and I am scared<br/>My heart You will defend</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>[Chorus]<br/>You are on my side<br/>You go before me<br/>You stand behind<br/>You tell my fear to run<br/>Always and forever<br/>I am loved</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>You are on my side, oh oh<br/>You are on my side, oh oh</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>[Verse 2]<br/>In the tragedy, You grieve with me<br/>Your comfort is my song<br/>In my wandering, You're still rescuing<br/>You will never, never give up</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>[Chorus]<br/>You are on my side<br/>You go before me<br/>You stand behind<br/>You tell my fear to run<br/>Always and forever<br/>I am loved</lines>

      <lines>[Bridge]<br/>You were on my side<br/>You were on my side<br/>When I couldn't see<br/>When I couldn't feel<br/>When the pain was real<br/>You were on my side<br/>You were on my side<br/>When You saved me from my heart of stone<br/>You awoke these bones<br/>You were on my side<br/>You were on my side<br/>Nothing on this earth could ever<br/>Separate me from Your love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>[Chorus]<br/>You are on my side<br/>You go before me<br/>You stand behind<br/>You tell my fear to run<br/>Always and forever<br/>I am loved</lines>
