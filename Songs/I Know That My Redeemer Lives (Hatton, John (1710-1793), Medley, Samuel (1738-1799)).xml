    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I know that my Redeemer lives; What comfort this sweet sentence gives! He lives, He lives, who once was dead; He lives, my ever living Head.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He lives to bless me with His love, He lives to plead for me above. He lives my hungry soul to feed, He lives to help in time of need.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He lives triumphant from the grave, He lives eternally to save, He lives all glorious in the sky, He lives exalted there on high.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He lives to grant me rich supply, He lives to guide me with His eye, He lives to comfort me when faint, He lives to hear my soul's complaint.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He lives to silence all my fears, He lives to wipe away my tears He lives to calm my troubled heart, He lives all blessings to impart.</lines>
    </verse>
