    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, <br/>And time shall be no more, <br/>And the morning breaks, <br/>Eternal, bright and fair; <br/>When the saved of earth shall<br/>Gather over on the other shore, <br/>And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>On that bright and cloudless morning <br/>When the dead in Christ shall rise, <br/>And the glory of His resurrection share; <br/>When His chosen ones shall gather <br/>To their home beyond the skies, <br/>And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Let us labor for the Master from <br/>The dawn till setting sun, <br/>Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care; <br/>Then when all of life is over, <br/>And my work on earth is done, <br/>And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>When the roll is called up yonder, <br/>When the roll is called up yonder,  <br/>When the roll is called up yonder, <br/>When the roll is called up yonder,I'll be there.</lines>
