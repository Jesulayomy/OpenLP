    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I bow my knee in reverence, in awe of Your glory;<br/>Humbly I approach You now, with praise and adoration.<br/>I lift my hands in worship, giving You all honor;<br/>I'll join the heavenly hosts of angels now and sing:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,<br/>Who was and is and is to come.<br/>The Lion of Judah, the soon and coming King;<br/>Jesus, You are crowned with praise.</lines>
