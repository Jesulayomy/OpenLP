    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise the Lord, ye heav'ns, adore Him; Praise Him, angels in the height. Sun and moon, rejoice before Him; Praise Him, all ye stars of light. Praise the Lord, for He hath spoken; Worlds His mighty voice obeyed. Laws which never shall be broken For their guidance He hath made.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Praise the Lord, for He is glorious; Never shall His promise fail. God hath made His saints victorious; Sin and death shall not prevail. Praise the God of our salvation; Hosts on high, His pow'r proclaim. Heav'n and earth and all creation, Laud and magnify His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Worship, honor, glory, blessing, Lord, we offer unto Thee. Young and old, Thy praise expressing, In glad homage bend the knee. All the saints in Heav'n adore Thee; We would bow before Thy throne. As Thine angels serve before Thee, So on earth Thy will be done.</lines>
