  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've watched my dreams all fade away, and blister in the sun;<br/>Everything I've ever had's unraveled and undone.<br/>I've set upon a worthless stack, of my ambitious plans<br/>And the people that I've loved the most, have turned their backs and ran.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>This is the good life, I've lost everything<br/>I could ever want, and ever dream of.<br/>This is the good life, I found everything<br/>I could ever need, here in Your arms.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Loneliness has left me searching for someone to love.<br/>Poverty has changed my view of what true riches are.<br/>Sorrow's opened up my eyes, To see what real joy is.<br/>Pain has been the catalyst to my heart's happiness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>What good would it be<br/>If you had everything,<br/>But you didn't have was<br/>The only thing you need?</lines>
    </verse>
