    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The advent of our God Shall be our theme for prayer Come, let us meet him on the road And place for Him prepare.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The everlasting Son Incarnate stoops to be, Himself the servant's form puts on To set His people free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Come, Zion's daughter, rise To meet your lowly King, Nor let your faithless heart despise The peace He comes to bring.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>As judge, on clouds of light, He soon will come again And all His scattered saints unite With Him on high to reign.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Before the dawning day Let sin be put to flight; No longer let the law hold sway, But walk in freedom's light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>All glory to the Son<br/>Who comes to set us free,<br/>With Father, Spirit, ever One,<br/>Through all eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
