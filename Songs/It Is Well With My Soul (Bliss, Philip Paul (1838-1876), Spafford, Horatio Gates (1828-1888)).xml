    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When peace like a river attendeth my way,<br/>When sorrows like sea billows roll;<br/>Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,<br/>"It is well, it is well with my soul."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>It is well, (it is well,)<br/>With my soul, (with my soul,)<br/>It is well, it is well with my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,<br/>Let this blest assurance control,<br/>That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,<br/>And hath shed his own blood for my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought!<br/>My sin, not in part but the whole<br/>Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,<br/>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,<br/>The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;<br/>The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,<br/>Even so, it is well with my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
