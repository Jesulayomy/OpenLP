    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I believe in faithfulness, I believe in giving of myself,<br/>For someone else;<br/>I believe in peace and love, I believe in honesty and trust,<br/>but it's not enough;<br/>For all that I believe may never change the way it is,<br/>unless I believe Jesus lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Where there is faith, there is a voice calling,<br/>"Keep walking, you're not alone in this world;"<br/>Where there is faith, there is a peace like a child sleeping<br/>hope everlasting in He<br/>Who is able to bear every burden to heal every hurt in my heart;<br/>It is a wonderful, powerful place: where there is faith.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There's a man across the sea, never heard the sound of freedom ring,<br/>Only in his dreams;<br/>There's a lady dressed in black, in a motorcade of Cadillacs,<br/>Daddy's not coming back;<br/>And our hearts begin to fall and our stability grows weak,<br/>But Jesus meets our needs if we only believe.</lines>
