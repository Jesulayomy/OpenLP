    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse: 1<br/>I lived, Heart on a wire<br/>Hand in the fire for so long<br/>But You've shown me better, A new kind of love<br/>It's ever the one, I want</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Pre Chorus:<br/>I'm lifting you higher, higher<br/>There's nothing that I'd rather do<br/>A sweet elevation of praises<br/>There's no one I love more than You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>I never knew a-<br/>Love like this before, The kind of life that-<br/>I cannot find on my own, I've seen the world but I have-<br/>Never been so sure, That I want Your-<br/>Heart, God I just want to be where You are<br/>Where You are, I just want to be where You are</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse: 2<br/>Your love, like nothing I've seen<br/>My wildest of dreams don't come close<br/>Life never no better than living like this<br/>I cannot resist You Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>And after all this time with You by my side<br/>I can't imagine what it'd be like on my own<br/>I've made up my heart, this love is all I've got<br/>And You're the only one I know worth living for</lines>
    </verse>
