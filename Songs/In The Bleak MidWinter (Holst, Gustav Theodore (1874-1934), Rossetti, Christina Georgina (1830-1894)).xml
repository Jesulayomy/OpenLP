  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan, Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone; Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow on snow, In the bleak midwinter, long ago.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Our God, Heav'n cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain; Heav'n and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign. In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day, Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay; Enough for Him, whom angels fall down before, Ox and ass and camel which adore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Angels and archangels may have gathered there, Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air; But His mother only, in her maiden bliss, Worshiped the beloved with a kiss.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>What can I give Him, poor as I am? If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb; If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part; Yet what can I give Him: give my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
