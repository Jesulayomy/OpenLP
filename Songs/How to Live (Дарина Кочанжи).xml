      <lines>Verse 1:<br/>Oh, my God, here I am, here's my soul in front of You,<br/>I don't have words, I don't have tears and all my hope is in You<br/>You know my life, You know my way and every my step You know<br/>So help me God to understand, what can I do? Where should I go?</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Tell me how to live when I don't see the sense<br/>When I don't see the sense<br/>Show me where is the hand that will help me to stand.<br/>That will help me to stand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse 2:<br/>How to see we are blind, how to hear we are deaf<br/>to feel, if our mind cannot love and forgive?</lines>

      <lines>Bridge:<br/>Tell me how to live when I don't see the sense<br/>When I don't see the sense, when I don't see<br/>Show me where is the hand that will help me to stand.<br/>That will help me to stand.</lines>
