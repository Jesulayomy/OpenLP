    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As with gladness men of old<br/>Did the guiding star behold;<br/>As with joy they hailed its light,<br/>Leading onward, beaming bright,<br/>So, most gracious God, may we<br/>Evermore be led by Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>As with joyful steps they sped,<br/>Saviour, to Thy lowly bed,<br/>There to bend the knee before<br/>Thee whom heaven and earth adore,<br/>So may we with willing feet<br/>Ever seek Thy mercy-seat.<br/>As they offered gifts most rare<br/>At Thy cradle rude and bare,<br/>So may we with holy joy,<br/>Pure, and free from sinâ€™s alloy,<br/>All our costliest treasures bring,<br/>Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Holy Jesus, every day<br/>Keep us in the narrow way;<br/>And, when earthly things are past,<br/>Bring our ransomed souls at last<br/>Where they need no star to guide,<br/>Where no clouds Thy glory hide.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>In the heavenly country bright<br/>Need they no created light;<br/>Thou its light, its joy, its crown,<br/>Thou its sun, which goes not down.<br/>There forever may we sing<br/>Hallelujahs to our King.</lines>
    </verse>
