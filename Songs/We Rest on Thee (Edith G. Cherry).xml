      <lines>We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender!<br/>We go not forth alone against the foe;<br/>Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,<br/>We rest on Thee and in Thy name we go.<br/>Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,<br/>We rest on Thee, and in Thy name we go.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Yes, in Thy name, O Captain of salvation!<br/>In Thy dear name, all other names above,<br/>Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,<br/>Our Prince of glory and our King of love.<br/>Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,<br/>Our Prince of glory and our King of love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We go in faith, our own great weakness feeling,<br/>And needing more each day Thy grace to know:<br/>Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing;<br/>We rest on Thee, and in Thy name we go.<br/>Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing;<br/>We rest on Thee, and in Thy name we go.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender!<br/>Thine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise;<br/>When passing through the gates of pearly splendour,<br/>Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days.<br/>When passing through the gates of pearly splendour,<br/>Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days.</lines>
