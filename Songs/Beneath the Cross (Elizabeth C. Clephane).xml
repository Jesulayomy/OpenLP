    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Beneanth the cross of Jesus<br/>I fain would take my stand,<br/>The shadow of a mighty rock<br/>Within a weary land;<br/>A home within the wilderness,<br/>A rest upon the way,<br/>From the burning of the noontide heat,<br/>And the burden of the day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O safe and happy shelter!<br/>O refuge tried and sweet!<br/>O trysting place where heaven’s love<br/>And heaven’s justice meet!<br/>As to the holy patriarch<br/>That wondrous dream was given,<br/>So seems my Saviour’s cross to me<br/>A ladder up to heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There lies, beneath its shadow,<br/>But on the farther side,<br/>The darkness of an awful grave<br/>That gapes both deep and wide;<br/>And there between us stands the cross,<br/>Two arms outstretched to save;<br/>Like a watchman set to guard the way<br/>From that eternal grave.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Upon that cross of Jesus<br/>Mine eye at times can see<br/>The very dying form of One<br/>Who suffered there for me;<br/>And from my smitten heart, with tears,<br/>Two wonders I confess—<br/>The wonders of His glorious love,<br/>And my own worthlessness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I take, O cross, thy shadow,<br/>For my abiding place;<br/>I ask no other sunshine than<br/>The sunshine of His face;<br/>Content to let the world go by,<br/>To know no gain nor loss—<br/>My sinful self my only shame,<br/>My glory all the cross.</lines>
    </verse>
