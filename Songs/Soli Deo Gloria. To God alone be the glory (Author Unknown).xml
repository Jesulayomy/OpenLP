      <lines>Soli Deo Gloria. To God alone be the glory.<br/>Soli Deo Gloria. To God alone be the glory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>From the watercolor sunset to the em'rald trees,<br/>In the raging of the ocean, in the rustling of the leaves,<br/>It's the heartbeat of the forest, it's the rhythm in the rain;<br/>It's the song of all creation that will never be contained.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Let it thunder through the mountains, let it roar across the plain.<br/>Let His mercy and His wonder be an anthem unrestrained.<br/>It's the shout of ev'ry pilgrim, who's been shown the holy place.<br/>It's the cry of ev'ry sinner who's been covered by His grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Ev'ry woman, ev'ry man and ev'ry creature in the land,<br/>Has been designed to understand there is a higher power.<br/>Ev'ry woman, ev'ry man, and ev'ry creature in the land,<br/>Has been created by His hand. He is a mighty tower.</lines>
