    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In a time of desperation, when all we know is doubt and fear,<br/>There is only one foundation: we believe, we believe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In this broken generation, when all is dark, You help us see;<br/>There is only one salvation: we believe, we believe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>We believe in God the Father, we believe in Jesus Christ,<br/>We believe in the Holy Spirit, and He's given us new life.<br/>We believe in the crucifixion, we believe that He conquered hell,<br/>We believe in His resurrection, and that He's coming back again.<br/>We believe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Let our faith be more than anthems, greater than the songs we sing;<br/>In our weakness and temptations we believe, we believe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Let the lost be found and dead be raised, in the here and now, let love invade,<br/>Let the Church live loud our God will save: we believe, we believe.<br/>And the gates of hell shall not prevail, for the power of God has torn the veil,<br/>Now we know your love will never fail: we believe, we believe.</lines>
    </verse>
