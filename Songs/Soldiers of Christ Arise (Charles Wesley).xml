    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Soldiers of Christ, arise,<br/>And put your armour on; <br/>Strong in the strength which God supplies, <br/>Through His eternal Son;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Strong in the Lord of hosts, <br/>And in His mighty power; <br/>Who in the strength of Jesus trusts <br/>Is more than conqueror.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Stand, then, in His great might,<br/>With all His strength endued;<br/>And take, to arm you for the fight,<br/>The panoply of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Leave no unguarded place, <br/>No weakness of the soul; <br/>Take every virtue, every grace, <br/>And fortify the whole.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>From strength to strength go on, <br/>Wrestle and fight and pray; <br/>Tread all the powers of darkness down, <br/>And win the well-fought day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>That having all things done, <br/>And all your conflicts past, <br/>Ye may oâ€™ercome, through Christ alone, <br/>And stand complete at last.</lines>
