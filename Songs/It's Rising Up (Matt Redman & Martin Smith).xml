    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It's rising up from coast to coast,<br/>From north to south, and east to west;<br/>The cry of hearts that love Your name,<br/>Which with one voice we will proclaim.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The former things have taken place,<br/>Can this be the new day of praise?<br/>A heav'nly song that comes to birth,<br/>And reaches out to all the earth</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>Oh let the cry to nations ring,<br/>That all may come and all may sing:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>'Holy is the Lord'<br/>(Every heart sing)<br/>'Holy is the Lord'<br/>(With one voice sing)<br/>'Holy is the Lord'<br/>(All the earth sing)<br/>'Holy is the Lord'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And we have heard the lion's roar,<br/>That speaks of heaven's love and power.<br/>Is this the time, is this the call<br/>That ushers in Your kingdom rule?<br/>Oh let the cry to nations ring,<br/>That all may come and all may sing:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>'Jesus is alive'<br/>(Every heart sing)<br/>'Jesus is alive'<br/>(With one voice sing)<br/>'Jesus is alive'<br/>(All the earth sing)<br/>'Jesus is alive'</lines>
