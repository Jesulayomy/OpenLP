    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Black cars in line<br/>The family has arrived<br/>The church fills up<br/>They've come to say goodbye<br/>If this was my last day<br/>What would they have to say?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Did I live a life of love<br/>Did I give myself away<br/>Will my kids think of you<br/>When they speak my name<br/>Was I always full of hope<br/>Always reaching out<br/>I wanna cross the finish line<br/>And know I made it count<br/>Before you call me home<br/>Before you call me home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I wanna be a man<br/>Who builds his children up<br/>With a wife who feels<br/>Like she's been truly loved<br/>And if I've let them down<br/>Lord help me start right now</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I wanna live a life of love<br/>I wanna give myself away<br/>I want my kids to think of you<br/>When they speak my name<br/>Always full of hope<br/>Always reaching out<br/>I wanna cross the finished line<br/>And know I made it count<br/>Before you call me home<br/>Before you call me home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>And when I finally close my eyes<br/>And wake up on the other side<br/>With my life laid out in the sun<br/>I wanna hear you say well done, well done</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>I wanna live a life of love<br/>I wanna give myself away<br/>I want my kids to think of you<br/>When they speak my name<br/>Always full of hope<br/>Always reaching out<br/>I wanna cross the finish line<br/>And know I made it count<br/>Before you call me home<br/>Before you call me home<br/>Before you call me home<br/>Before you call me home<br/>(Before you call me home)...</lines>
