    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who is there like You,<br/>And who else would give their life for me,<br/>Even suffering in my place?<br/>And who could repay You?<br/>All of creation looks to You,<br/>And You provide for all You have made.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So I'm lifting up my hands,<br/>Lifting up my voice, lifting up Your name,<br/>And in Your grace I rest,<br/>For Your love has come to me<br/>And set me free.<br/>And I'm trusting in Your word,<br/>Trusting in Your cross, trusting in Your blood<br/>And all Your faithfulness,<br/>For Your power at work in me<br/>Is changing me.</lines>
