    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When the devil comes in, comes in like a flood,<br/>When darkness surrounds you and cannot look up,<br/>When heartache and sorrow will never seem done,<br/>Look to Jesus, who's already run.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Look to Jesus, who's already run.<br/>Look to Jesus, the Glorified Son.<br/>Look to Jesus, who said, 'It is done.'<br/>Look to Jesus, who's already won.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>As witnesses call us again to go on<br/>To a life that will count for eternity on,<br/>Move forward by faith and lay the sin aside,<br/>Look to Jesus, who's already run.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Can you see him in glory, on His throne of grace?<br/>Have you seen our Lord suffering, despising the shame?<br/>Consider the cost in redeeming the lost?<br/>Look to Jesus, who finished His race.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Look to Jesus, the author of faith.<br/>Look to Jesus, the giver of grace.<br/>Look to Jesus, and finish your race.<br/>Look to Jesus, who's already won.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>Look to Jesus, who sits on the throne.<br/>Look to Jesus, who calls me His own.<br/>Look to Jesus and heaven, our home.<br/>Look to Jesus, who's already won.</lines>
    </verse>
