      <lines>Intro: Bm D x2<br/>Let now the weak say "I have strength"<br/>By the spirit of power, that raised Christ from the dead<br/>let now the poor stand and confess<br/>that my portion is him, and I'm more than blessed</lines>

      <lines>Let now your church shine as your bride<br/>that you saw in your heart, as you offered up your life<br/>let now the lost be welcomed home<br/>by the saved and redeemed, those adopted as your own</lines>
    </verse>
