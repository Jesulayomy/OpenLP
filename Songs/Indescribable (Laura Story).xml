    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea,<br/>Creation's revealing Your majesty.<br/>From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring,<br/>Every creature unique in the song that it sings,<br/>All exclaiming:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Indescribable, uncontainable,<br/>You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.<br/>You are amazing God.<br/>All powerful, untameable,<br/>Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim:<br/>You are amazing God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go?<br/>Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow?<br/>Who imagined the sun and gave source to its light?<br/>Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night?<br/>None can fathom.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>You are amazing, God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Indescribable, uncontainable,<br/>You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.<br/>You are amazing God.<br/>Incomparable, unchangeable,<br/>You've seen the depths of my heart and You love me the same.<br/>You are amazing God.<br/>You are amazing God.</lines>
    </verse>
