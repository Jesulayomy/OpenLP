    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>On my perilous heart<br/>To befriend me to my bitter end<br/>And carry the burden<br/>For as graven my failure<br/>You prevailed in pure love<br/>To be found in the depths of Your heart<br/>As good as forgiven<br/>O how You graced that cross<br/>Where Jesus died and death took the loss<br/>Wild as the floodgates of heaven<br/>Flung wide open within His scars<br/>Now mine is the life You raised<br/>Yours the glory that took down that grave<br/>Bright as the sun almighty in love<br/>God forever Your Kingdom come<br/>O how sweet is the sound<br/>Of a heart drenched in grace<br/>Rising up from the ashes in praise<br/>Alive to Your greatness<br/>Hope as brazen as mercy<br/>Through the terrible night<br/>How You blaze through the darkness I fight<br/>Bright as the morning<br/>O how You graced that cross<br/>Where Jesus died and death took the loss<br/>Wild as the floodgates of heaven<br/>Flung wide open within His scars<br/>Now mine is the life You raised<br/>Yours the glory that took down that grave<br/>Bright as the sun almighty in love<br/>God forever Your Kingdom come<br/>My heart burns wild in my chest<br/>In awe of Your heart in all that You are<br/>Let Your praise run wild on my breath<br/>In awe of Your heart I'll sing it again<br/>How My heart burns wild in my chest<br/>In awe of Your heart in all that You are<br/>Let Your praise run wild on my breath<br/>In awe of Your heart I'll sing it again<br/>How My heart burns wild in my chest<br/>In awe of Your heart in all that You are<br/>Let Your praise run wild on my breath<br/>In awe of Your heart I'll sing it again<br/>Till my heart beats out of my chest<br/>I'll sing of Your love in awe of Your heart<br/>Till Your praise is all I have left<br/>I'll sing of Your love again and again<br/>Till my heart beats out of my chest<br/>I'll sing of Your love in awe of Your heart<br/>Till Your praise is all I have left<br/>I'll sing of Your love again and again<br/>How You graced that cross<br/>Where Jesus died and death took the loss<br/>Wild as the floodgates of heaven<br/>Flung wide open within His scars<br/>Mine is the life You raised<br/>Yours the glory that took down that grave<br/>Bright as the sun almighty in love<br/>God forever Your Kingdom come<br/>Bright as the sun<br/>Let us see Your Kingdom come<br/>Bright as the sun<br/>Have Your way Your Kingdom come</lines>
