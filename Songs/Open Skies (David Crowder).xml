    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise Him under open skies,<br/>ev'rything breathing, praising God<br/>In the company of all who love the King.<br/>I will dance. I will sing. It could be heavenly.<br/>Turn the music loud, lift my voice and shout.<br/>From where I am, from where I've been,<br/>He's been there with me, He's built a monument:<br/>His very people, so let His people sing, sing sing.</lines>
