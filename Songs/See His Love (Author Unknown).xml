    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>See His love nailed onto a cross<br/>Perfect and blameless life<br/>given as sacrifice<br/>See Him there all in the name of love<br/>Broken yet glorious,<br/>all for the sake of us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>This is Jesus in His glory<br/>King of Heaven dying for me<br/>It is finished, He has done it<br/>Death is beaten, Heaven beckons me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Greater love no one could ever show<br/>Mercy so undeserved,<br/>freedom I should not know<br/>All my sin, all of my hidden shame<br/>Died with Him on the cross,<br/>eternity won for us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>// Such love, such love<br/>Such love is this for me  //</lines>
