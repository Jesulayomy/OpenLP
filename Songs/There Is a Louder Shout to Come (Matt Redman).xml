    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is a louder shout to come, there is a sweeter song to hear;<br/>All the nations with one voice, all the people with one fear.<br/>Bowing down before Your throne, every tribe and tongue will be;<br/>All the nations with one voice, all the people with one King.<br/>And what a song we'll sing upon that day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O what a song we'll sing and O what a tune we'll bear;<br/>You deserve an anthem of the highest praise.<br/>O what a joy will rise and O what a sound we'll make;<br/>You deserve an anthem of the highest praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now we see a part of this, one day we shall see in full;<br/>All the nations with one voice, all the people with one love.<br/>No one else will share Your praise, nothing else can take Your place;<br/>All the nations with one voice, all the people with one Lord.<br/>And what a song we'll sing upon that day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Even now upon the earth, there's a glimpse of all to come;<br/>Many people with one voice, harmony of many tongues.<br/>We will all confess Your name, You will be our only praise;<br/>All the nations with one voice, all the people with one God.<br/>And what a song we'll sing upon that day.</lines>
