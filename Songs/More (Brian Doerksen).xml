  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>More than oxygen, I need your love;<br/>More than life giving food the hungry dream of.<br/>More than an eloquent word depends on the tongue;<br/>More than a passionate song needs to be sung.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>More than a word could ever say<br/>More than a song could ever convey;<br/>I need You more than all of these things.<br/>Father I need You more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>More than magnet and steel are drawn to unite.<br/>More than poets love words to rhyme as they write.<br/>More than comforting warmth of sun in spring.<br/>More than the eagle loves wind under its wings.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>More than a blazing fire on a winter's night,<br/>More than the tall evergreens reach for the light.<br/>More than the pounding waves long for the shore;<br/>More than these gifts you give, I love you more.</lines>
    </verse>
