    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>My Deliverer is coming, my Deliverer is standing by.<br/>My Deliverer is coming, my Deliverer is standing by.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Through a dry and thirsty land, water from the Kenyan heights.<br/>Pours itself out of Lake Sangri's broken heart.<br/>There in the Sahara winds, Jesus heard the whole world cry,<br/>For the healing that would flow from His own scars.<br/>The world was singing:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>He will never break His promise, He has written it upon the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b2">

    </verse>
    <verse name="b3">
      <lines>He will never break His promise,<br/>though the stars should break faith with the sky.</lines>
