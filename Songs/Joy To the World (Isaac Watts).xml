    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Joy to the world! the Lord has come;<br/>Let earth receive her King.<br/>Let every heart prepare Him room,<br/>And heaven and nature sing,<br/>And heaven and nature sing,<br/>And heaven, and heaven and nature sing!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Joy to the earth! the Saviour reigns;<br/>Your sweetest songs employ.<br/>While fields and streams and hills and plains<br/>Repeat the sounding joy,<br/>Repeat the sounding joy,<br/>Repeat, repeat the sounding joy!<br/>He rules the world with truth and grace,<br/>And makes the nations prove<br/>The glories of His righteousness,<br/>The wonders of His love,<br/>The wonders of His love,<br/>The wonders, the wonders of His love.</lines>
