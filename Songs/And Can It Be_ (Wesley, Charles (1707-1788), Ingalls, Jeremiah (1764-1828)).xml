    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>And can be that I should gain,<br/>an interest in my Savior's blood?<br/>Died He for me, who caused His pain?<br/>For me, who Him to death pursued?<br/>Amazing love, how can it be<br/>That thou my Lord should die for me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Amazing love, how can it be<br/>That thou my God should die for me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Long my imprisoned spirit lay,<br/>Fast bound in sin and nature's night,<br/>Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,<br/>I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;<br/>My chains fell off, my heart was free,<br/>I rose, went forth and followed thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No condemnation now I dread,<br/>Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;<br/>Alive in Him, my living Head<br/>and clothed with righteousness divine,<br/>Bold I approach the eternal throne,<br/>And claim the crown through Christ, my own.</lines>
