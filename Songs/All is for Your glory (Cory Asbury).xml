    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's just one chief end to man's purpose<br/>One main reason for existence<br/>All man's vain and high ambitions<br/>Will one day be brought low will one day be brought low</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To treasure You above all others<br/>To love You like we love no other<br/>Your greatness soon will be uncovered<br/>Will one day be brought low will one day be brought low</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>For You alone will be exalted in that day<br/>Worthless goals will be exposed as idols that we've made<br/>For You alone will be exalted in that day<br/>You'll be seen as rightful King and from our hearts we'll say</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>All is for Your glory<br/>All is for Your name<br/>All is for Your glory<br/>That in all things You may have the first place<br/>That in all things You may have preeminence</lines>

    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>So put me anywhere, just put Your glory in me<br/>I'll serve anywhere, just let me see Your beauty<br/>So put me anywhere, just put Your glory in me<br/>I'll serve anywhere, just let me see Your beauty</lines>
