    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You have opened the door<br/>to the riches of God<br/>and poured out Your life for the lost<br/>The Lamb Who was slain<br/>You erased all our sin<br/>Purchased men with Your blood<br/>and made us as priests unto God<br/>The Lamb Who was slain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>You are worthy<br/>You are faithful<br/>You are holy<br/>The Lamb Who was slain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You came down as a Man<br/>and You suffered the cross<br/>The King of the heavens became<br/>The Lamb Who was slain<br/>But our God raised You up<br/>and our tongues now confess<br/>That You are the Lord and the Christ<br/>The Lamb Who was slain</lines>
