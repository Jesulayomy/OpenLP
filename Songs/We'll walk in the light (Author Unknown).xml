    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>We'll walk in the light, beautiful light,<br/>Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright;<br/>Shine all around us by day and by night,<br/>Jesus, the light of the world.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Hear the Saviour's earnest call,<br/>Jesus, the light of the world;<br/>Send the Gospel truth to all,<br/>Jesus, the light of the world.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Why not seek Him then today,<br/>Jesus, the light of the world;<br/>Go with truth the narrow way,<br/>Jesus, the light of the world.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come, confess Him as your King,<br/>Jesus, the light of the world;<br/>Then the bells of heaven will ring,<br/>Jesus, the light of the world.</lines>
