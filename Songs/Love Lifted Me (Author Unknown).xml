    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I was sinking deep in sin,<br/>far from the peaceful shore,<br/>very deeply stained within,<br/>sinking to rise no more;<br/>but the Master of the sea<br/>heard my despairing cry,<br/>from the waters lifted me;<br/>now safe am I.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Love lifted me!<br/>Love lifted me!<br/>When nothing else could help,<br/>Love lifted me.<br/>Love lifted me!<br/>Love lifted me!<br/>When nothing else could help,<br/>Love lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Souls in danger, look above,<br/>Jesus completely saves;<br/>he will lift you by his love<br/>out of the angry waves.<br/>He's the Master of the sea,<br/>billows his will obey;<br/>he your Savior wants to be -<br/>be saved today.</lines>
