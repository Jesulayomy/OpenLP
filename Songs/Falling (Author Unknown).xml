      <lines>Verse 1:<br/>I would like to walk this world with you, always<br/>Never want to be apart from you, O Lord<br/>I am sometimes overwhelmed by Truth and Your ways</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Could it be that I was made for You, I'm blown away<br/>I am falling, I am falling in love<br/>I am falling in love, I am falling in love with You<br/>I am falling, I am falling in love<br/>    Esus<br/>I am falling in love,<br/>I am falling in love with You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Verse 2:<br/>Would You stay and listen for awhile, please stay<br/>And let me talk of how You make me smile, oh...<br/>I would like to leave it all behind, my ways<br/>But I get caught up in myself sometimes<br/>All I can say</lines>
