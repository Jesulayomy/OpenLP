    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I stand accused, there's a list a mile long<br/>Of all my sins, of everything that I've done wrong<br/>I'm so ashamed, there's nowhere left for me to hide<br/>This is the day, I must answer for my life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>My fate is in the Judges hands,<br/>But then he turns to me and says</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I know you, I love you<br/>I gave my life, to save you<br/>Love paid the price for mercy<br/>My verdict, not guilty</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse 2:<br/>How can it be, I cannot begin to comprehend<br/>What kind of Grace would take the place for all my sins<br/>I stand in awe, now that I have been set free<br/>And the tears well up, as I look at that Cross<br/>'Cause it should've been me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p2">
      <lines>My fate was in the nail scarred hands,<br/>He stretched them out for me and said...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I'm falling on my knees to thank You<br/>With everything I am, I praise You<br/>So grateful for the words I heard you say</lines>
