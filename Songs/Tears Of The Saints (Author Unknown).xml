    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There are many prodigal songs<br/>On our city streets they run, searching for shelter<br/>There are homes broken down<br/>People's hopes have fallen to the ground from failures</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>This is an emergency</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>There are tears from the saints<br/>For the lost and unsaved<br/>We're crying for them come back home<br/>We're crying for them come back home<br/>And all Your children will stretch out their hands<br/>And pick up the crippled man<br/>Father, we will lead them home<br/>Father, we will lead them home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There are schools full of hatred<br/>Even churches have forsaken love and mercy<br/>May we see this generation<br/>In this state of desperation for Your glory</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Sinner, reach out your hands<br/>Children, in Christ you stand<br/>Sinner, reach out your hands<br/>Children, in Christ you stand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>And all Your children will stretch out their hands<br/>And pick up the crippled man<br/>Father, we will lead them home<br/>Father, we will lead them home</lines>
