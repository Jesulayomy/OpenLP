    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In Christ alone my hope is found.<br/>He is my light, my strength, my song.<br/>This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,<br/>Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.<br/>What heights of love, what depths of peace!<br/>When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!<br/>My Comforter, my All in All:<br/>Here in the love of Christ I stand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In Christ alone! who took on flesh,<br/>Fullness of God in helpless babe!<br/>This Gift of love and righteousness,<br/>Scorned by the ones He came to save.<br/>Till on that cross as Jesus died,<br/>The wrath of God was satisfied.<br/>For every sin on Him was laid:<br/>Here in the death of Christ I live.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There in the ground His body lay,<br/>Light of the world by darkness slain.<br/>Then bursting forth in glorious Day,<br/>Up from the the grave He rose again!<br/>And as He stands in victory,<br/>Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me!<br/>For I am His and He in mine,<br/>Bought with the precious blood of Christ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>No guilt in life, no fear in death,<br/>This is the power of Christ in me!<br/>From life's first cry to final breath,<br/>Jesus commands my destiny!<br/>No power of hell, no scheme of man,<br/>Can ever pluck me from His hand!<br/>Till He returns or calls me home:<br/>Here in the power of Christ I'll stand!</lines>
