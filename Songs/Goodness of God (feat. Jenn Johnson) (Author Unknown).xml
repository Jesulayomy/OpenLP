      <lines>Intro:<br/>I love you, Lord for your mercy never fails me<br/>All my days, I've been held in your hands<br/>From the moment that I wake up till I lay my head down<br/>I will sing of the goodness of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>All my life you have been faithful<br/>All my life you have been so, so good<br/>With every breath that I am able<br/>I will sing of the goodness of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I love your voice You have led me through the fire<br/>In darkest night you are close like no other<br/>I've known you as a father I've known you as a friend<br/>I have lived in the goodness of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Your goodness is running after, It's running after me<br/>Your goodness is running after, It's running after me<br/>With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now I give you everything<br/>Your goodness is running after, It's running after me</lines>
