  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All my dreams I had dreamed were dreams of me.<br/>All my hopes were desires of what I wanted to be.<br/>With ambitions put aside,<br/>I crawl in Your arms to hide.<br/>I have given everything up to You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>This is all, this is everything.<br/>This is all, this is everything.<br/>Everything I've got.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The good things and the bad things are in Your hands.<br/>My hopes and my dreams are in Your command.<br/>And I come before You now<br/>As imperfect as I am<br/>And I give, yes I give it all to You.</lines>
    </verse>
