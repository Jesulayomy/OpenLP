    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Take a look at the mountain,<br/>stretching a mile high.<br/>Take a look at the ocean,<br/>far as your eye can see,<br/>And think of Me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Take a look at the desert.<br/>Do you feel like a grain of sand?<br/>I am with you wherever;<br/>where you go is where I am.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>And I'm always thinking of you.<br/>Take a look around you;<br/>I'm spelling it out one by one.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I love you more than the sun<br/>And the stars that I taught how to shine.<br/>You are Mine, and you shine for Me too.<br/>I love you yesterday and today and tomorrow;<br/>I'll say it again and again:<br/>I love you more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Just a face in the city,<br/>just a tear on a crowded street.<br/>But you are one in a million,<br/>and you belong to Me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p2">
      <lines>And I want you to know<br/>that I'm not letting go,<br/>Even when you come undone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Shine for Me.  You shine for Me.<br/>You shine on. You shine on. You shine for Me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>I love you more than the sun<br/>And the stars that I taught how to shine.<br/>You are mine, and you shine for me too.<br/>I love you yesterday and today and tomorrow;<br/>I'll say it again and again:<br/>I love you more than the sun<br/>And the stars that I taught how to shine.<br/>You are mine, and you shine for me too.<br/>I love you yesterday and today, through the joy and the pain,<br/>I'll say it again and again:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b2">
      <lines>I love you more.<br/>I love you more.<br/>And I see you, and I made you,<br/>And I love you more than you can imagine,<br/>More than you can fathom.<br/>I love you more than the sun,<br/>and you shine for Me.</lines>
    </verse>
