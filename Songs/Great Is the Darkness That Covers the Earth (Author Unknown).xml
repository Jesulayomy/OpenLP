    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Great is the darkness that covers the Earth,<br/>Oppression, injustice and pain.<br/>Nations are slipping in hopeless despair,<br/>Though many have come in Your name.<br/>Watching while sanity dies,<br/>Touched by the madness and lies.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Come, Lord Jesus, come, Lord Jesus!<br/>Pour out Your Spirit we pray.<br/>Come, Lord Jesus, come, Lord Jesus!<br/>Pour out Your Spirit on us today!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>May now your church rise with power and love,<br/>This glorious gospel proclaim.<br/>In every nation salvation will come<br/>To those who believe in Your name.<br/>Help us bring light to this world<br/>That we might speed Your return.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Great celebrations on that final day<br/>When out of the heavens You come.<br/>Darkness will vanish, all sorrow will end,<br/>And rulers will bow at Your throne.<br/>Our great commission complete,<br/>Then face to face we shall meet.</lines>
