    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I sing the mighty pow'r of God, That made the mountains rise; That spread the flowing seas abroad, And built the lofty skies. I sing the wisdom that ordained The sun to rule the day: The moon shines full at His command, And all the stars obey.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I sing the goodness of the Lord, That filled the earth with food: He formed the creatures with His word, And then pronounced them good. Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed, Where'er I turn my eye; If I survey the ground I tread, Or gaze upon the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's not a plant or flow'r below, But makes Thy glories known; And clouds arise and tempests blow, By order from Thy throne. Creatures that borrow life from Thee Are subject to Thy care: There's not a place where we can flee, But God is present there.</lines>
