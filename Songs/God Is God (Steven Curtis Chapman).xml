    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>And the pain falls like a curtain<br/>On the things I once called certain.<br/>And I have to say the words I fear the most:<br/>I just don't know.<br/>And the questions without answers<br/>Come and paralyze the dancer.<br/>So I stand here on the stage afraid to move,<br/>Afraid to fall. Oh, but fall I must<br/>On this truth that my life has been formed from the dust.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>God is God and I am not.<br/>I can only see a part of the picture He's painting.<br/>God is God and I am man,<br/>So I'll never understand it all,<br/>For only God is God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And the sky begins to thunder,<br/>And I'm filled with awe and wonder,<br/>'Til the only burning question that remains<br/>Is who am I?<br/>Can I form a single mountain?<br/>Take the stars in hand and count them?<br/>Can I even take a breath without God giving it to me?<br/>He is first and last, before all that has been,<br/>Beyond all that will pass.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Oh, how great are the riches of His wisdom and knowledge.<br/>How unsearchable for to Him and through Him and from Him are<br/>all things.<br/>So, let us worship before the throne<br/>Of the One who is worthy of worship alone.</lines>
    </verse>
