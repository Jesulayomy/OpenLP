    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I saw the cleansing fountain<br/>Open wide for all my sin,<br/>I obeyed the Spirit's wooing,<br/>When He said, Wilt thou be clean?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>CHORUS<br/>I will praise Him! I will praise Him!<br/>Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;<br/>Give Him glory, all ye people,<br/>For His blood has washed away<br/>each stain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Though the way seems straight<br/>and narrow,<br/>All I claimed was swept away;<br/>My ambitions, plans, and wishes,<br/>At my feet in ashes lay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Then God's fire upon the altar<br/>Of my heart was set aflame;<br/>I shall never cease to praise Him,<br/>Glory, glory to His name!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Blessed be the name of Jesus!<br/>I'm so glad He took me in;<br/>He's forgiven my transgressions,<br/>He has cleansed my heart from sin.</lines>
    </verse>
