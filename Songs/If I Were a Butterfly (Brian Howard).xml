    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>If I were a butterfly<br/>I'd thank you Lord for giving me wings<br/>If I were a robin in a tree<br/>I'd thank you Lord that I could sing<br/>If I were a fish in the sea<br/>I'd wiggle my tail and I'd giggle with glee<br/>But I just thank you Father for making me, me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>For you gave me a heart and you gave me a smile<br/>You gave me Jesus and you made me your child<br/>And I just thank you Father for making me, me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>If I were an elephant<br/>I'd thank you Lord by raising my trunk<br/>If I were a kangaroo<br/>You know I'd hop right up to you<br/>If I were an octopus<br/>I'd thank you Lord for my fine looks<br/>But I just thank you Father for making me, me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>If I were a wiggly worm<br/>I'd thank you Lord that I could squirm<br/>If I were a fuzzy, wuzzy bear<br/>I'd thank you Lord for my fuzzy, wuzzy hair<br/>If I were a crocodile I'd thank you Lord for my great smile<br/>But I just thank you Father for making me, me</lines>
