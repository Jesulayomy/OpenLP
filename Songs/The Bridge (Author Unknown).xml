    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The world's getting darker by the day<br/>I'm on my knees but don't know what to pray<br/>The broken things that broken people do<br/>But knowing just how far You came for me<br/>Gives me hope for every soul I'll meet<br/>There's no one so far gone that You can't reach<br/>So reach through me<br/>Let them see, Lord, let them see</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Your love is the bridge You built with the cross<br/>And Your truth is the light that searches for the lost<br/>Your grace won't stop reaching, Your mercy won't let go<br/>'Cause Your love is the bridge and Your truth leads us-<br/>Home, home<br/>You lead us<br/>Home, home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You never told the broken they were whole<br/>You spoke the truth that healed their broken souls<br/>You'd never leave us here to fight alone<br/>With love we earn the right to speak Your truth<br/>It's not just what we say it's what we do<br/>I wanna be a bridge that leads to You<br/>So reach through me<br/>Let them see, Lord, let them see</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>No rescue so relentless<br/>No greater love than this<br/>Where sin leaves a canyon<br/>Your love builds a bridge<br/>No rescue so relentless<br/>No greater love than this<br/>Where sin leaves a canyon<br/>Your love builds a bridge<br/>No rescue so relentless<br/>No greater love than this<br/>Where sin leaves a canyon<br/>Your love builds a bridge<br/>Your love builds a bridge</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Your love is the bridge You built with the cross<br/>And Your truth is the light that searches for the lost<br/>Your grace won't stop reaching, Your mercy won't let go<br/>'Cause Your love is the bridge, 'cause Your love is the bridge</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No rescue so relentless<br/>No greater love than this<br/>Where sin leaves a canyon<br/>Your love builds a bridge</lines>
