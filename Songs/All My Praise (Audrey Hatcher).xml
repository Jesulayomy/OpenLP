    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>And even in the shadow of death I will praise You.<br/>And even in the valley I will say:</lines>
    </verse>

      <lines>Holy, My God, You are worthy of all my praise.<br/>Holy, My God, You are worthy of all my praise.</lines>

      <lines>You are seated on Your throne in heaven and You<br/>see all of us down here.<br/>You have promised you will not abandon and so I<br/>shall not fear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>You made every star, and you taught it how to shine.<br/>You knew my name before there was time.<br/>And all this was just part of your glorious design.<br/>Hallelujah, Hallelujah.</lines>

      <lines>Holy, My God, You are worthy of all my praise.<br/>Holy, My God, You are worthy of all my praise.</lines>
