  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>    In a little corner of the world lived a maiden,<br/>Pure in heart, good in deed, full of grace, gentle rose;<br/>An angelic salutation for the Word's annunciation<br/>She's to be the chosen mother of Jesus, our Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And as she listened to the voice with her gaze upon the splendor<br/>Love embraced her open heart, and she conceived the holy Lord.<br/>"Behold the handmaid, behold your servant,<br/>Be it done unto me according to Your word."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>    In a little time there would be a celebration<br/>Elizabeth would bear a son, they will call his name John.<br/>He will go before the Lord as a faithful messenger<br/>He'll prepare the way for the Lamb who is to come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And on that day was put in motion the means of our redemption,<br/>And a way was opened up as a highway to our God;<br/>And a child was born to us, and to us a Son was given,<br/>Through the young and blessed Mary came the greatest Gift of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Holy, holy, holy Redeemer, Holy, holy is the Lord;<br/>Blessed is He who comes to free us,<br/>Blessed is He who comes in the Name of the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
