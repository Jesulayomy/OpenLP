    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!<br/>O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!<br/>All ye who hear,<br/>Brothers and sisters, draw near,<br/>Praise Him in glad adoration.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;<br/>Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee:<br/>Ponder anew<br/>What the Almighty can do,<br/>Who with His love doth befriend thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Praise to the Lord, who doth nourish thy life and restore thee,<br/>Fitting thee well for the tasks that are ever before thee,<br/>Then to thy need<br/>He like a mother doth speed,<br/>Spreading the wings of grace oâ€™er thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Praise to the Lord, who when tempests their warfare are waging,<br/>Who, when the elements madly around thee are raging,<br/>Biddeth them cease,<br/>Turneth their fury to peace,<br/>Whirlwinds and waters assuaging.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Praise to the Lord, who, when darkness of sin is abounding,<br/>Who, when the godless do triumph, all virtue confounding,<br/>Sheddeth His light,<br/>Chaseth the horrors of night,<br/>Saints with His mercy surrounding.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore Him!<br/>All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him!<br/>Let the Amen<br/>Sound from His people again:<br/>Gladly for aye we adore Him.</lines>
    </verse>
