      <lines>Be still for the presence of the Lord<br/>The Holy One is here<br/>Come bow before Him now<br/>With reverence and fear<br/>In Him no sin is found<br/>We stand on holy ground<br/>Be still for the presence of the Lord<br/>The Holy One is here</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Be still for the glory of the Lord<br/>Is shining all around<br/>He burns with holy fire<br/>With splendour He is crowned<br/>How awesome is the sight<br/>Our radiant King of light<br/>Be still for the glory of the Lord<br/>Is shining all around</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Be still for the power of the Lord<br/>Is moving in this place<br/>He comes to cleanse and heal<br/>To minister His grace<br/>No work too hard for Him<br/>In faith receive from Him<br/>Be still for the power of the Lord<br/>Is moving in this place</lines>
