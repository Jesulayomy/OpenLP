  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The first noel, the angel did say,<br/>Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay,<br/>In fields where they lay, a keeping their sheep,<br/>On a cold winter's night that was so deep.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Noel, noel, noel, noel,<br/>Born is the King of Israel.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>They looked up and saw a star,<br/>As it shone in the east beyond them far.<br/>And to the earth, it gave great light,<br/>And so it continued both day and night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And by the light of that same star,<br/>Three wise men came from country far,<br/>To seek for a King was their intent,<br/>And to follow the star wherever it went.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The star drew nigh to the north-west,<br/>O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest,<br/>And there it did both stop and stay,<br/>Right over the place where Jesus lay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Then entered in those wise men three,<br/>Full reverently upon their knee,<br/>And offered there in His presence,<br/>Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Then let us all with one accord<br/>Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,<br/>Who hath made heaven and earth of nought,<br/>And with His blood mankind hath bought.</lines>
    </verse>
