      <lines>I lay my life down at Your feet<br/>Cause You're the only One I need<br/>I turn to You and You are always there<br/>In troubled times it's You I seek<br/>I put You first that's all I need<br/>I humble all I am, all to You</lines>
    </verse>

      <lines>One way, Jesus, You're the only One that I could live for<br/>One way, Jesus, You're the only One that I could live for</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You are always always there<br/>Everyhow and everywhere<br/>Your grace abounds so deeply within me<br/>You will never ever change<br/>Yesterday, today the same<br/>Forever 'til forever meets no end</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>You are the Way, the Truth, and the Life<br/>We live by faith and not by sight, for You<br/>We're living all for You</lines>
