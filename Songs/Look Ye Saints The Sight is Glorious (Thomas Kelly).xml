    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious;<br/>See the Man of Sorrows now,<br/>From the fight returned victorious;<br/>Every knee to Him shall bow:<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crowns become the Victor’s brow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Crown the Saviour, angels, crown Him;<br/>Rich the trophies Jesus brings;<br/>In the seat of power enthrone Him,<br/>While the vault of heaven rings:<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crown the Saviour, King of kings!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sinners in derision crowned Him,<br/>Mocking thus the Saviour’s claim;<br/>Saints and angels throng around Him,<br/>Own His title, praise His name:<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Spread abroad the Victor’s fame.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Hark, those bursts of acclamation!<br/>Hark, those loud triumphant chords!<br/>Jesus takes the highest station:<br/>O what joy the sight affords!<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>King of kings, and Lord of lords!</lines>
