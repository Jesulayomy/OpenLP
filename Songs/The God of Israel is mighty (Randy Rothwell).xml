    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The God of Israel is mighty<br/>The God of Israel knows no defeat<br/>He leads His people into battle<br/>Before Him His enemies must flee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Cry out with a shout of victory<br/>Lift your voice all the earth<br/>Sing and dance at the triumph of our King<br/>For He has won the war<br/>And spoiled the enemy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The God of Israel is our champion<br/>His right arm has got the victory<br/>Our praises rise as incense before Him<br/>He fights for us and routs the enemy</lines>
