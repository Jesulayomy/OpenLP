    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There are people almost everywhere<br/>Whose hearts are all aflame<br/>With the Fire that fell at Pentecost,<br/>Which made them all acclaim.<br/>"It is burning now within my heart,<br/>All, glory to His Name.<br/>And I'm glad that I can say I'm one of them."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>(Chorus)<br/>One of them, one of them.<br/>I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them.<br/>One of them, one of them.<br/>I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Though these people may not learned be,<br/>Nor boast of worldly fame,<br/>They have all received their Pentecost,<br/>Baptized in Jesus' Name.<br/>And are telling now both far and wide,<br/>His power is yet the same.<br/>And I'm glad that I can say I'm one of them.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>They were gathered in the upper room,<br/>All praying in His Name.<br/>They were baptized with the Holy Ghost,<br/>And power for service came.<br/>Now what He did for them that day<br/>He'll do for you the same.<br/>And I'm glad that I can say I'm one of them.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Come, my brother, seek this blessing<br/>That will cleanse your heart from sin,<br/>That will start the joy bells ringing,<br/>And will keep the soul aflame.<br/>It is burning now within my heart,<br/>All glory to His Name.<br/>And I'm glad that I can say I'm one of them.</lines>
