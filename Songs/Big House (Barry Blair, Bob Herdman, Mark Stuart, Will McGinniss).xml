    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I don't know where you lay your head or where you call your home.<br/>I don't know where you eat your meals or where you talk on the phone.<br/>I don't know if you got a cook, a butler, or a maid.<br/>I don't know if you got a yard with a hammock in the shade.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I don't know if you got some shelter, say, a place to hide.<br/>I don't know if you live with friends in whom you can confide.<br/>I don't know if you got a family say a mom or dad.<br/>I don't know if you feel love at all, but I bet you wish you had.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Come and go with me to my Father's house.<br/>Come and go with me to my Father's house.<br/>It's a big, big house with lots and lots of room.<br/>A big, big table with lots and lots of food.<br/>It's a big, big yard where we can play football.<br/>A big, big house; it's my Father's house.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>All I know is a big ol' house with rooms for everyone.<br/>All I know is lots of land where we can play and run.<br/>All I know is you need love and I've got a family.<br/>All I know is you're all alone, so why not come with me?</lines>
