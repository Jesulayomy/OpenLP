    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hope has found its home within me<br/>Now that I've been found in You<br/>Let all that I am be all You want me to be<br/>'Cause all I want is more of You<br/>'Cause all I want is more of You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Let Your presence fall upon us<br/>I want to see You face to face<br/>Let me live forever lost in Your love<br/>'Cause all I want is more of You<br/>'Cause all I want is more of You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I'm living for this cause<br/>I lay down my life into Your hands<br/>I'm living for the truth<br/>The hope of the world, in You I'll stand</lines>
