    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I fear my faith will fail, Christ will hold me fast;<br/>When the tempter would prevail, He will hold me fast.<br/>I could never keep my hold through life's fearful path;<br/>For my love is often cold; He must hold me fast.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He will hold me fast, He will hold me fast;<br/>For my Saviour loves me so, He will hold me fast.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Those He saves are His delight, Christ will hold me fast;<br/>Precious in his holy sight, He will hold me fast.<br/>He'll not let my soul be lost; His promises shall last;<br/>Bought by Him at such a cost, He will hold me fast.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For my life He bled and died, Christ will hold me fast;<br/>Justice has been satisfied; He will hold me fast.<br/>Raised with Him to endless life, He will hold me fast<br/>'Till our faith is turned to sight, When He comes at last!</lines>
