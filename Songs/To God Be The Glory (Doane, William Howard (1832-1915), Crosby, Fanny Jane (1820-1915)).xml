    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>To God be the glory, great things He hath done.<br/>So loved He the world that He gave us His Son<br/>Who yielded His life an atonement for sin<br/>And opened the lifegate that all may go in.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br/>Let the earth hear His voice!<br/>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br/>Let the people rejoice!<br/>O come to the Father through Jesus the Son<br/>And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,<br/>To every believer, the promise of God.<br/>The vilest offender who truly believes,<br/>That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Great things He hath taught us.<br/>Great things He hath done,<br/>And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son.<br/>But purer and higher and greater will be<br/>Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see.</lines>
    </verse>
