    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My God can never fail,<br/>He's been proved time and again<br/>Trust Him and see<br/>He's got all the power you need<br/>He's never early, never late<br/>It takes courage, it takes faith<br/>Trust Him and see<br/>He's got all the power you need</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>He saves, forgives, and heals<br/>Takes back what the devil steals<br/>My debt's been paid in full<br/>And every day He does miracles</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I got dreams, turn them into plans<br/>Too big for human hands<br/>Trust Him and see<br/>He's got all the power you need<br/>He's real, He's real<br/>Faith's a lot stronger than what you feel<br/>He's real, He's real<br/>I'm believing for miracles</lines>
