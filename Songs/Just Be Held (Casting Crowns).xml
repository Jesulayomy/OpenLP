    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hold it all together, everybody needs you strong,<br/>But life hits you out of nowhere and barely leaves you holding on<br/>And when you're tired of fighting, chained by your control<br/>There's freedom in surrender, lay it down and let it go</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus<br/>So when you're on your knees and answers seem so far away,<br/>You're not alone, stop holding on, and just be held,<br/>Your world's not falling apart, it's falling into place<br/>I'm on the throne, stop holding on, and just be held<br/>Just be held<br/>Just be held</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>If your eyes are on the storm, you'll wonder if I love you still<br/>But if your eyes are on the cross, you know I always have and I always will<br/>And not a tear is wasted, in time you'll understand<br/>I'm painting beauty with the ashes, your life is in My hands</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Repeat Chorus 1x</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Bridge<br/>Lift your hands, lift your eyes, in the storm is where you'll find Me<br/>And where you are, I'll hold your heart, I'll hold your heart<br/>Come to Me, find your rest,<br/>In the arms of the God who won't let go</lines>
    </verse>
