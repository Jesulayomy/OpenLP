    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Follow the star to a place unexpected<br/>Would you believe after all we've projected<br/>A child in a manger<br/>Lowly and small, the weakest of all<br/>Unlikeliest hero, wrapped in his mothers shawl<br/>Just a child<br/>Is this who we've waited for?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>How many kings, stepped down from their thrones?<br/>How many lords have abandoned their homes?<br/>How many greats have become the least for me?<br/>How many Gods have poured out their hearts<br/>To romance a world that has torn all apart?<br/>How many fathers gave up their sons for me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Bringing our gifts for the newborn savior<br/>All that we have whether costly or meek<br/>Because we believe<br/>Gold for his honor and frankincense for his pleasure<br/>And myrrh for the cross he'll suffer<br/>Do you believe, is this who we've waited for?<br/>It's who we've waited for</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Only one did that for me<br/>Oh......... oh........<br/>All for me, all for you (repeat ad lib)<br/>All for me, all for you</lines>
    </verse>
