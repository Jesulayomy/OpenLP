  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I stand among the millions, and I can't help but feel so small,<br/>For I am just a speck of dust, a particle existing on this great big spinning ball.<br/>The part of me that's human, it tells me I am not that strong,<br/>There's a power in my soul, greater than us all, and I'm reminded I am not my own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I'm yielded to a higher calling: I'm...<br/>One voice, shining through the darkest night.<br/>One voice, standing up for what is right.<br/>One voice, nothing more and nothing less,<br/>Than a voice crying out, a voice in the wilderness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The voices of confusion, can fill a world that's all my own.<br/>Running havoc through my mind, all the truth and all the lies,<br/>It's so hard to sift the right from wrong.<br/>In the middle of the choosing, through the clutter of this human noise,<br/>When my words fall to the ground, all the dust has settled down,<br/>All that matters is Your still small voice.</lines>
    </verse>
