    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I see Your face in every sunrise<br/>The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes<br/>The world awakens in the light of the day<br/>I look up to the sky and say<br/>You're beautiful</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I see Your power in the moonlit night<br/>Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright<br/>We are amazed in the light of the stars<br/>It's all proclaiming who You are<br/>You're beautiful, You're beautiful</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I see you there hanging on a tree<br/>You bled and then you died and then you rose again for me<br/>Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne<br/>Soon we will be coming home<br/>You're beautiful, you're beautiful</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When we arrive at eternity's shore<br/>Where death is just a memory and tears are no more<br/>We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring<br/>Your bride...</lines>
    </verse>
