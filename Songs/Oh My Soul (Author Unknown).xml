    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh my soul<br/>Oh how you worry, Oh how you weary from fearing<br/>You lost control<br/>This was the one thing you didn't see coming<br/>And no one would blame you, no<br/>If you cried in private, If you tried to hide it away<br/>So no one knows<br/>No one will see if you stop believing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh my soul, you are not alone<br/>There's a place where fear<br/>Has to face the God you know<br/>One more day, He will make a way<br/>Let Him show you how you can lay this down<br/>'Cause You're not alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Here and now,<br/>You can be honest, I won't try to promise<br/>That someday it all works out<br/>Cause this is the valley, and even now he is breathing<br/>On your dry bones<br/>And there will be dancing<br/>There will be beauty where beauty was ash and stone<br/>This much I know</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Oh my soul, you are not alone<br/>There's a place where fear<br/>Has to face the God you know<br/>One more day, He will make a way<br/>Let Him show you how you can lay this down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I'm not strong enough<br/>I can't take anymore<br/>(You can lay it down, you can lay it down)<br/>And my shipwrecked faith will never get me to shore<br/>(You can lay it down, you can lay it down)<br/>Can He find me here<br/>Can He keep me from going under</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>Oh my soul, you are not alone<br/>There's a place where fear<br/>Has to face the God you know<br/>One more day, He will make a way<br/>Let Him show you how you can lay this down<br/>'Cause You're not alone</lines>
