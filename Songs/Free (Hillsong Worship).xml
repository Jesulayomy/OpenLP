      <lines>Would you believe me if I said<br/>That we are the ones who can make the change<br/>In the world today<br/>Would you believe me if I said<br/>That all of your dreams in your heart<br/>Can come true today<br/>Would you believe me if I said<br/>That life could be all that you want it to be today</lines>

      <lines>And if I had wings I would fly<br/>'Cause all that I need, You are<br/>And if the world caved in around me<br/>To You I'd still hold on<br/>'Cause You're all that I believe<br/>And the one that created me<br/>Jesus because of You I'm free</lines>

      <lines>Would you believe me if I said<br/>That God can make miracles happen today<br/>Would you believe me if I said<br/>That you don't need to wait for the answers before<br/>You step out in faith<br/>Would you believe me if I said<br/>That nothing is ever impossible for God</lines>
