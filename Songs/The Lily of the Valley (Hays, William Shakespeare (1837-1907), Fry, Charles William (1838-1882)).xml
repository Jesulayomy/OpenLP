    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me, He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul; The Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole. In sorrow He's my comfort, In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay; He tells me every care on Him to roll. He's the Lily in trouble He's my stay; He tells me every care on Him to roll. He's the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star, He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He all my grief has taken, and all my sorrows borne; In temptation He's my strong and mighty tow'r; I'll all for Him forsake now, I'll all my idols tear From my heart for now He keeps me by His pow'r. Though all the world forsake me, In sorrow He's my comfort, and Satan tempt me sore, Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal. He's the Lily in trouble He's my stay; He tells me every care on Him to roll. He's the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star, He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He'll never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here, So I live by faith and do His blessed will; A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear, With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill. When crown'd at last in glory, In sorrow He's my comfort, I'll see His blessed face, Where rivers of delight shall ever roll. He's the Lily in trouble He's my stay; He tells me every care on Him to roll. He's the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star, He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</lines>
