    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I may never march in the Infantry, (march)<br/>Ride in the cavalry, (pretend you're riding a horse)<br/>Shoot the artillery. (clap hands together)<br/>I may never zoom o'er the enemy, (spread arms out and pretend to be a plane)<br/>But I'm in the Lord's Army. (point one finger up to God)<br/>I'm in the Lord's Army, (yes, sir!) (salute)<br/>I'm in the Lord's Army, (yes, sir!)<br/>I may never march in the Infantry,<br/>Ride in the cavalry,<br/>Shoot the artillery.<br/>I may never zoom o'er the enemy,<br/>But I'm in the Lord's Army, (yes, sir!)</lines>
