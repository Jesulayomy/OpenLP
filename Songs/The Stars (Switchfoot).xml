    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Maybe I've been the problem.<br/>Maybe I'm the one to blame.<br/>But even when I turn it off and blame myself,<br/>The outcome feels the same.<br/>I've been thinking maybe I've been partly cloudy.<br/>Maybe I'm the chance of rain.<br/>And maybe I'm overcast,<br/>And maybe all my luck's washed down the drain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>I've been thinking 'bout everyone,<br/>Everyone you look so lonely.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>But when I look at the stars,<br/>When I look at the stars,<br/>When I look at the stars, I see someone else.<br/>When I look at the stars,<br/>The stars, I feel like myself.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Stars looking at a planet,<br/>Watching entropy and pain,<br/>And maybe start to wonder<br/>How the chaos in our lives could pass as sane.<br/>I've been thinking 'bout the meaning of resistance,<br/>Of a hope beyond our own,<br/>And suddenly the infinite and penitent<br/>Begin to look like home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Everyone, everyone feels so lonely.<br/>Everyone, yeah everyone feels so empty.<br/>When I look at the stars,<br/>When I look at the stars,<br/>When I look at the stars, I feel like myself.<br/>When I look at the stars,<br/>The stars, I see someone...</lines>
