      <lines>He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason<br/>He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason<br/>There is nothing in this world worth living for<br/>It only leaves you empty and longing for more<br/>He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason.</lines>

    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've been blessed with so many things,<br/>God's been good to me<br/>I have family and friends who share in all I do<br/>But if I lose it all and I am left with nothing<br/>If I have the Lord, then I know I'll make it through.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason<br/>He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason<br/>There is nothing in this world worth living for<br/>It only leaves you empty and longing for more<br/>He's the only reason I live, but oh, what a reason.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You may have tried a lot of things to find true happiness<br/>But if you've looked very long then you know it just can't be found<br/>Until you find the Lord and the power of His spirit<br/>He'll be your reason to live and He'll never let you down</lines>
