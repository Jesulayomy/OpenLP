    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Am I at the point  of no improvement?<br/>What of the death I still dwell in?<br/>I try to excel, but I feel no movement.<br/>Can I be free of this unreleasable sin?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Never underestimate my Jesus.<br/>You're telling me that there's no hope.<br/>I'm telling you you're wrong.<br/>Never underestimate my Jesus.<br/>When the world around you crumbles, He will be strong.<br/>He will be strong.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I throw up my hands. "Oh, the impossibilities."<br/>Frustrated and tired, where do I go from here?<br/>Now I'm searching for the confidence I've lost so willingly.<br/>Overcoming these obstacles is overcoming my fear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I think I can't;  I think I can't,<br/>But I think You can; I think You can.<br/>I think I can't;  I think I can't,<br/>But I think You can; I think You can<br/>Gather my insuficiencies and place them in Your hands,<br/>Place them in Your hands.<br/>Place them in Your hands.</lines>
