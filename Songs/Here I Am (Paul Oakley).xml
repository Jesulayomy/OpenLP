    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Here I am, and I have come to thank You, Lord, for all You've done;<br/>Thank You, Lord.<br/>You paid the price at Calvary, You shed Your blood, You set me free;<br/>Thank You, Lord.<br/>No greater love was ever shown, no better life ever was laid down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And I will always love Your name;<br/>And I will always sing Your praise. x2</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You took my sin, You took my shame,<br/>You drank my cup, You bore my pain;<br/>Thank You, Lord.<br/>You broke the curse, You broke the chains,<br/>In victory from death You rose again;<br/>Thank You, Lord.<br/>And not by works, but by Your grace<br/>You clothe me now in Your righteousness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You bid me come, You make me whole,<br/>You give me peace, You restore my soul;<br/>Thank You, Lord.<br/>You fill my cup and when I'm full<br/>You give me more 'till I overflow;<br/>Thank You, Lord.<br/>You're making me to be like You,<br/>To do the works of the Father too.</lines>
