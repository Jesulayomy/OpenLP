    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse: 1<br/>The life You gave, Your body was broken<br/>Your love poured out, You bled and You died for me<br/>There on that cross, You breathed Your last as you were crucified<br/>You gave it all for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus: 1<br/>Hallelujah, what a Savior<br/>Hallelujah, what a friend<br/>Hallelujah, King forever<br/>We thank You for the cross</lines>

    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Verse: 2<br/>There in the ground, sealed in the darkness<br/>Lifeless laid, the frame of the Father's son<br/>In agony, He watched His only Son be sacrificed<br/>He gave it all for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Verse: 3<br/>But on that day, what seemed as the darkest hour<br/>A violent hope, broke through and shook the ground<br/>And as You rose, The Light of all the world was magnified<br/>And You rose in victory</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Chorus: 2<br/>Hallelujah, it is finished<br/>Hallelujah, it is done<br/>Hallelujah King forever<br/>We thank you for the cross</lines>

    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Big Crashes:</lines>

    <verse name="b2">
      <lines>End tag:<br/>And though our sins are scarlet<br/>You have made us white as snow</lines>
