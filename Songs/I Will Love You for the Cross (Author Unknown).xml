    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And I love You for the cross<br/>I'm overwhelmed by the mystery<br/>I love You for the cost<br/>That Jesus You would do this for me<br/>When You were broken, You were beaten,<br/>You were punished, I go free<br/>When You were wounded and rejected<br/>In your mercy, I am healed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Jesus Christ the sinner's friend<br/>Does this kindness know no bounds?<br/>With Your precious blood<br/>You have purchased me<br/>Oh the mystery of the cross<br/>You were punished You were crushed<br/>But that punishment has become my peace<br/>Yes that punishment has become my peace</lines>
