    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How shall we answer terror's cry, The cunning blade, the flaming sky? When murderous spite knocks down our door And violence breaks upon our shore, O let us come and look to You To know Your will what shall we do?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When Satan whispers, 'Hate your foe, Now take your vengeance draw the bow,' Protect us from the tempter's guile, The lying voice, the evil smile. O let us come in trust to You, To hear the word we know is true.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When executioners hung You high You turned Your prayer up to the sky, And pled the Father to forgive, You asked that cruel men might live. O let us Your example take, And pray for sinners as we ache.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We pray that You their hearts will turn; And light a holy fire to burn Their dross away, so they may be Like gold refined, eternally. O let us pray that they become, Like us, with You forever one.</lines>
