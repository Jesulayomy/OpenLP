    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord You seem so far away<br/>A million miles or more it feels today<br/>And though I haven't lost my faith<br/>I must confess right now<br/>That it's hard for me to pray<br/>But I don't know what to say<br/>And I don't know where to start<br/>But as You give the grace<br/>With all that's in my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>I will sing, I will praise<br/>Even in my darkest hour<br/>Through my sorrow and my pain<br/>I will sing, I will praise<br/>Lift my hands to honor You<br/>Because Your Word is true<br/>I will sing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord it's hard for me to see<br/>All the thoughts and plans You have for me<br/>But I will put my trust in You<br/>Knowing that You died to set me free<br/>But I don't know what to say<br/>And I don't know where to start<br/>But as You give Your grace<br/>With all that's in my heart</lines>
