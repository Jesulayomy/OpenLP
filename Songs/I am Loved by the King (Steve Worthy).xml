    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I am loved by the King,<br/>In faith I'll soar on eagles wings.<br/>I will stand and I will sing of Your great love.<br/>For the universe declares, what a creator God You are,<br/>Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord, my God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Amazing love,<br/>Such power in the name of Jesus.<br/>Amazing love,<br/>There's healing in His hands.<br/>Amazing love,<br/>On a cross He died to save us.<br/>He died and rose again,<br/>I believe it, I receive Him and the Truth has set me free.</lines>
