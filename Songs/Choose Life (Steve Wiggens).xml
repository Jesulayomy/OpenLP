    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A choice is set before you now, living or dying blessing or cursing;<br/>And now the time has come around, to turn from your fighting and rest in His mercy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Trust the Lord with all your heart, with all of your soul and all of your being;<br/>Hold on listen and obey, surrender your life into His keeping.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Choose life, that you might live, the life that He gives,<br/>He gives you forever;<br/>Choose life, the way that is true, from the One who chose you,<br/>Your Father in heaven;<br/>Choose life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>And the weight that you're under will be lifted away;<br/>And the world will wonder what happened here today;<br/>And you'll stand right there and say...</lines>
