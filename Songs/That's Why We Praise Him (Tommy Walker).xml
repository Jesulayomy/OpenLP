    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He came to live, live a perfect life.<br/>He came to be the Living Word, our light.<br/>He came to die so we'd be reconciled.<br/>He came to rise to show His power and might.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>That's why we praise Him, that's why we sing.<br/>That's why we offer Him our everything.<br/>That's why we bow down and worship this King.<br/>'Cause He gave His everything.<br/>'Cause He gave His everything.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He came to live, live again in us.<br/>He came to be our conquering King and Friend.<br/>He came to heal and show the lost ones His love.<br/>He came to go prepare a place for us.</lines>

    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Halle, Hallelujah!<br/>Halle, Hallelujah!</lines>
