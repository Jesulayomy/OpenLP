      <lines>We've come to praise You<br/>'Cause You're worthy<br/>Nobody like You in Your glory<br/>We love to praise You<br/>'Cause You're holy, awesome<br/>Wonderful, mighty God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And everything that You do<br/>Comes from a heart of love<br/>And a hand of mercy<br/>For You are faithful and true<br/>Working all things for good<br/>For those who love You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For if God in love did not spare His Son<br/>But He gave Him up for His chosen ones<br/>How much more will He freely give to us<br/>Who call upon His name?<br/>Who call upon His name?<br/>Who call upon His name?<br/>Who call upon His name?</lines>
