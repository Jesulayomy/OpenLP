    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Grace, You've shown me grace<br/>You've lifted my shame<br/>Drawn me with loving kindness<br/>Washed whiter than snow<br/>You have redeemed and made me whole</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Jesus, You have won me<br/>You have broken every Chain with love and mercy<br/>You have triumphed over Death and You are worthy<br/>Of glory and praise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Love, You've shown me love<br/>By leaving Your throne<br/>By bleeding and dying on a cross<br/>That wonderful cross<br/>That took all my guilt and sin away</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Shout it out and lift up one voice in worship<br/>Sing it out until all the earth can hear it<br/>Jesus is alive and He saves, He rescues and saves</lines>
