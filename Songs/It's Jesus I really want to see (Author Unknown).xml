    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have truly known the good life filled with family and friends<br/>I have been blessed with more than my shares<br/>Yet with all of my good fortune<br/>My heart is seeking still<br/>No, I just can't t deny the longing there</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus<br/>It's Jesus I really want to see<br/>The more I see of this world, the less it means to me<br/>For it's Jesus I really want to see</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I have been a lot of places<br/>And I have known the great and small<br/>I have seen the grand and noble works of me<br/>But in all of all my heart<br/>I know there's much for me<br/>So much more than this faded world at hand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Chorus2<br/>It's Jesus I really want to see<br/>The more I see of this world, the less it means to me<br/>For it's Jesus I really want to see</lines>
