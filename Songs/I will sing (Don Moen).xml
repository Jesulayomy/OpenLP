    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord You seem so far away<br/>A million miles or more it feels today<br/>And though I haven't lost my faith,<br/>I must confess right now<br/>that it's hard for me to pray<br/>But I dont know what to say<br/>and I dont know where to start<br/>But as You give the grace<br/>with all that's in my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I will sing<br/>I will praise<br/>even in my darkest time<br/>through the sorrow and the pain<br/>I will sing<br/>I will praise<br/>Lift my hands to honor You<br/>because Your word is true<br/>I will sing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord it's hard for me to see<br/>all the thoughts and plans You have for me<br/>But I will put my trust in You,<br/>Knowing that You died to set me free<br/>But I dont know what to say<br/>and I dont know where to start<br/>But as You give the grace<br/>with all that's in my heart</lines>
