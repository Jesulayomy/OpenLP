    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come, let us join our cheerful songs,<br/>With angels round the throne;<br/>Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,<br/>But all their joys are one.<br/>‘Worthy the Lamb that died,’ they cry,<br/>‘To be exalted thus.’<br/>‘Worthy the Lamb,’ our lips reply,<br/>‘For He was slain for us.’</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus is worthy to receive<br/>Honour and power divine:<br/>And blessings, more than we can give,<br/>Be, Lord, forever Thine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Let all that dwell above the sky,<br/>And air, and earth, and seas,<br/>Conspire to lift Thy glories high,<br/>And speak Thine endless praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The whole creation join in one<br/>To bless the sacred name<br/>Of Him that sits upon the throne<br/>And to adore the Lamb.</lines>
