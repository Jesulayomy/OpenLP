    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I was seeking You among the stars,<br/>Among the colors of flowering fields.<br/>I was looking for You at the time of thunderstorms<br/>And the radiance of sunny days.<br/>I was looking for You but not there!<br/>You whispered softly from the inside,<br/>In my heart sounded the soft voice:<br/>«My dear child, look at the soul!»</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>"I am with you always, I'm at the heart.<br/>Call only Me, - I will come in love!"<br/>"I am with you always, I'm at the heart.<br/>Call only Me, - I will come in love!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You were there, my God, always<br/>Watching me, You waited quietly.<br/>And when I sought You,<br/>You showed me the right way.<br/>I looked for You - and I found,<br/>You whispered softly from the inside,<br/>In my heart sounded the soft voice:<br/>«My dear child, look at the soul!»</lines>
