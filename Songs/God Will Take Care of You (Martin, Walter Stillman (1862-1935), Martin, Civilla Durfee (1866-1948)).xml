    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Be not dismayed whate'er betide, God will take care of you; Beneath His wings of love abide, God will take care of you. God will take care of you, through ev'ry day, o'er all the way; He will take care of you, God will take care of you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Through days of toil when heart doth fail, God will take care of you; When dangers fierce your path assail, God will take care of you. God will take care of you, through ev'ry day, o'er all the way; He will take care of you, God will take care of you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>All you may need He will provide, God will take care of you; Nothing you ask will be denied, God will take care of you. God will take care of you, through ev'ry day, o'er all the way; He will take care of you, God will take care of you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>No matter what may be the test, God will take care of you; Lean, weary one, upon His breast, God will take care of you. God will take care of you, through ev'ry day, o'er all the way; He will take care of you, God will take care of you.</lines>
