    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>VERSE 1<br/>Fate<br/>Holds nothing on the providence I know<br/>No longer bound to things of wood and stone<br/>When all I had to offer was my worst<br/>You saw my heavy heart and loved me first</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Your beauty staring down my brokenness<br/>You chose to throw Your heart into the mess<br/>Compassion crashing down upon my debt You were there</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>PRE-CHORUS 1<br/>All this time<br/>Like a river running through my failure<br/>You carried me all this time<br/>Like the splinters buried in<br/>Your shoulders You carry me now</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>CHORUS 1<br/>Hallelujah<br/>If ever now my heart cries hallelujah<br/>If ever now in the wonder of Your grace<br/>A thousand times a thousand years my soul<br/>Will say</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>VERSE 2<br/>Grace<br/>You saw the crushing weight my flesh deserved<br/>You kneeled and wrote forgiveness in the dirt<br/>And one by one the stones fell where they lay<br/>As one by one my accusers walked away<br/>With nothing left to throw they made a cross<br/>And knowing only love could count the cost<br/>You were there</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>PRE-CHORUS 2<br/>All this time<br/>Like a river running through my failure<br/>You carried me all this time<br/>Like the splinters buried in<br/>Your shoulders Your love carried all my shame<br/>Jesus how my soul will praise You<br/>You carried me all this way<br/>Like a diamond in the scars upon<br/>Your crown You carry me now</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>CHORUS 2<br/>Hallelujah<br/>If ever now my heart cries hallelujah<br/>If ever now in the wonder of Your grace<br/>A thousand times a thousand years<br/>My soul will say<br/>Hallelujah<br/>Forever now in the greatness of my Saviour<br/>Forever now in the brightness of<br/>Your Name Jesus on this rock I'll sing Your praise</lines>
