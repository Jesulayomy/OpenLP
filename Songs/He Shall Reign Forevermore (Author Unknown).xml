    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the bleak mid-winter, all creation groans<br/>For a world in darkness, frozen like a stone<br/>Light is breaking, in a stable for a throne</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore<br/>And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore<br/>Unto us a child is born<br/>The King of kings and Lord of lords<br/>And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>If I were a wise man, I would travel far<br/>And if I were a shepherd, I would do my part<br/>But poor as I am, I will give to Him my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Here within a manger lies<br/>The One who made the starry skies<br/>This baby born for sacrifice<br/>Christ, the Messiah<br/>Into our hopes, into our fears<br/>The Savior of the world appears<br/>The promise of eternal years<br/>Christ, the Messiah</lines>
    </verse>
