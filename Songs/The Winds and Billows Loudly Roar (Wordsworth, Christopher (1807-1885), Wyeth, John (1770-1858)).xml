    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The winds and billows loudly roar We flounder in the deep Our bark is frail, far off the shore, And Jesus is asleep.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>"Save us, we perish, Lord," they cry; To Thee we fly for aid; "Awake! awake!" they say; but why So faithless and afraid?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His head is pillow'd on the stern, As Man He is asleep; As God He all things does discern, And endless vigils keep.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He does the elements control; By His Almighty Will. The angry waves their surges roll; And at His Word are still.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>O ye, who in the Church's Bark O'er life's rough ocean sail, When all around is drear and dark, and human efforts fail,</lines>
    </verse>
