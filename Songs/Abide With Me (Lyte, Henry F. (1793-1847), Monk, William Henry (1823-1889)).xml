    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Abide with me; fast falls the eventide; The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide. When other helpers fail and comforts flee, Help of the helpless, O abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day; Earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away; Change and decay in all around I see; O Thou who changest not, abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word; But as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord, Familiar, condescending, patient, free. Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come not in terrors, as the King of kings, But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings, Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea? Come, Friend of sinners, and thus bide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Thou on my head in early youth didst smile; And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile, Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee, On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>I need Thy presence every passing hour.<br/>What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?<br/>Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?<br/>Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;<br/>Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.<br/>Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?<br/>I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;<br/>Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.<br/>Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;<br/>In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</lines>
