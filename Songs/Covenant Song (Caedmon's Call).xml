    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We belong to the Lion of Judah; we are Abraham's seed<br/>We belong to the God and creator of everything<br/>Let us raise up a covenant chorus; let us bring forth our lives<br/>To the one whose host gathers among us and fills the skies</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And raise up His name on high<br/>Raise up, you people of His pride<br/>Raise up and bear the fire that's in our eyes<br/>And in our lives and shows that we are not afraid</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In His light we can never be hidden; in His love we are healed<br/>We will shine through the night like a city upon a hill</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>So raise up His name on high<br/>Raise up, you people of His pride<br/>Raise up and bear the fire that's in our eyes<br/>And in our lives and shows that we are not afraid<br/>No we are not afraid;  no we are not afraid</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He delivers his people from bondage, sets the prisoner free<br/>He has given us love and salvation, His eternal legacy<br/>He will spare us the sword of His anger; he prepares us a home<br/>Where we'll worship in glory forever before His throne</lines>
    </verse>
