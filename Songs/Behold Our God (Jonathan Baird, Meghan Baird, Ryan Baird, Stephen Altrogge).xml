    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who has held the oceans in His hands?<br/>Who has numbered every grain of sand?<br/>Kings and nations tremble at His voice<br/>All creation rises to rejoice</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Behold our God, seated on His throne<br/>Come, let us adore Him<br/>Behold our King, nothing can compare<br/>Come, let us adore Him!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who has given counsel to the Lord?<br/>Who can question any of His words?<br/>Who can teach the One who knows all things?<br/>Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who has felt the nails upon His hands<br/>Bearing all the guilt of sinful man?<br/>God eternal, humbled to the grave<br/>Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>// You will reign forever (Let Your glory fill the earth) //</lines>
