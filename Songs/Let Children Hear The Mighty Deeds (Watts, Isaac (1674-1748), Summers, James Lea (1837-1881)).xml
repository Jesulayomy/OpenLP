    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Let children hear the mighty deeds Which God performed of old; Which in our younger years we saw, And which our fathers told.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He bids us make His glories known, His works of pow'r and grace; And we'll convey His wonders down Through every rising race.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Our lips shall tell them to our sons, And they again to theirs; That generations yet unborn May teach them to their heirs.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thus shall they learn in God alone Their hope securely stands, That they may ne'er forget His work But practice His commands.</lines>
