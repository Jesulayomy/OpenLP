    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The only thing I want in life<br/>Is to be known for loving Christ<br/>To build His church, to love His bride<br/>And make His name known far and wide</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>For this cause I live, for this cause I'd die<br/>I surrender all, for the cause of Christ<br/>All I once held dear, I will leave behind<br/>For my joy is this, oh the cause of Christ</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He is all my soul will prize<br/>Regardless of the joy or trial<br/>When agonizing questions rise<br/>In Jesus all my hope abides</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>For this cause I live, for this cause I'd die<br/>I surrender all, for the cause of Christ<br/>All I once held dear, I will leave behind<br/>For my joy is this, oh the cause of Christ</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Jesus my Jesus<br/>For Your glory for Your name<br/>Jesus my Jesus<br/>I will only sing Your praise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>For this cause I live, for this cause I'd die<br/>I surrender all, for the cause of Christ<br/>All I once held dear, I will leave behind<br/>For my joy is this, oh the cause of Christ</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>It is not fame that I desire<br/>Nor stature in my brother's eye<br/>I pray it's said about my life<br/>That I lived more to build Your name than mine</lines>
