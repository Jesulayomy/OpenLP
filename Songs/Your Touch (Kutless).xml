    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Staring at a blank wall and all its white washed face<br/>Not knowing why I had to choose this way<br/>I discern I was wrong in my way<br/>Looking for peace in another, another domain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>And I realize that its true I seek you, yes I seek you<br/>And I realize that its true I need you, yes I need you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And I reach and I touch you and I know that I need you<br/>To reach out and to touch me and I know<br/>I know that I need your touch</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Not knowing why I ever retreated from your arms<br/>A mistake I made<br/>Now oh Lord I feel your warm embrace, contentment<br/>fills my soul as joy lights my face</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>You Look into the sky<br/>and see His arms of love reaching out for you<br/>His arms of love and grace<br/>And you know you need him, you need his touch<br/>I need your, I need your.....touch</lines>
    </verse>
