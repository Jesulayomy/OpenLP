    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Out of the shadows Bound for the gallows<br/>A dead man walking till love came calling<br/>Rise up (rise up) Rise up (rise up)<br/>Six feet under I thought it was over<br/>An answer to prayer the voice of a Savior<br/>Rise up (rise up) Rise up (rise up)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>All at once I came alive<br/>This beating heart, these open eyes?<br/>They don't let go?<br/>The darkness should have known<br/>(You're still rolling rolling, you're still rolling rolling oh)<br/>You're still rolling stones (You're still rolling rolling oh)<br/>You're still rolling stones</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now that You saved me I sing 'cause You gave me<br/>A song of revival I put it on vinyl<br/>Rise up (rise up) Rise up (rise up)<br/>I once was blinded but now I see it<br/>I heard about the power and now I believe it<br/>Rise up (rise up) Rise up (rise up)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I thought that I was too far gone<br/>For everything I've done wrong<br/>Yeah, I'm the one who dug this grave<br/>But You called my name<br/>You called my name<br/>I thought that I was too far gone<br/>For everything I've done wrong<br/>Yeah, I'm the one who dug this grave<br/>But You called my name<br/>You called my name</lines>
