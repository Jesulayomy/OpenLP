    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>So many years I heard it told<br/>The story of compassion<br/>A prodigal son who left the fold<br/>And found no satisfaction<br/>On my knees, Lord, I cried out to You<br/>I'm so alone<br/>But if there's room in Your<br/>house for one more<br/>I'm ready to come back home?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus<br/>I know there is a place<br/>Where arms of compassion<br/>welcome me home<br/>Sweet mercy falls like rain<br/>I know there's a place called grace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>So many days I've dreamed of grace<br/>Yet I have to wonder<br/>How many times my human strength<br/>Has kept me from surrender<br/>The more I learn just to lean on the cross<br/>The more I see<br/>When I fall, I will fall to the place<br/>Where mercy reaches me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Chorus2<br/>If it seems that my courage is strong<br/>There's just one reason<br/>He's the Rock that my faith is built on<br/>He holds me in His arms<br/>Gives me strength to carry on</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Chorus</lines>
