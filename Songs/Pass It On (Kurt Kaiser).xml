    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It only takes a spark to get a fire going,<br/>And soon all those around, can warm up in its glowing;<br/>That's how it is with God's love, Once you've experienced it;<br/>You spread His love to everyone, you want to pass it on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>What a wondrous time is spring, when all the trees are budding,<br/>The birds begin to sing, the flowers start their blooming;<br/>That's how it is with God's love, Once you've experienced it;<br/>You want to sing, "It's fresh like spring", you want to pass it on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I wish for you my friend, this happiness that I've found,<br/>You can depend on Him, it matters not where you're bound;<br/>I'll shout it from the mountain top - PRAISE GOD! I want the world to know;<br/>The Lord of love has come to me, I want to pass it on.</lines>
