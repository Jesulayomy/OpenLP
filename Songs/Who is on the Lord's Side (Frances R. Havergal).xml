    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus, Thou hast bought us <br/>Not with gold or gem, <br/>But with Thine own life-blood, <br/>For Thy diadem. <br/>With Thy blessing filling <br/>Each who comes to Thee <br/>Thou hast made us willing, <br/>Thou hast made us free. <br/>By Thy grand redemption, <br/>By Thy grace divine, <br/>We are on the Lord’s side;<br/>Saviour, we are Thine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Fierce may be the conflict, <br/>Strong may be the foe, <br/>But the King’s own army <br/>None can overthrow; <br/>Round His standard ranging <br/>Victory is secure; <br/>For His truth unchanging <br/>Makes the triumph sure. <br/>Joyfully enlisting, <br/>By Thy grace divine, <br/>We are on the Lord’s side;<br/>Saviour, we are Thine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Chosen to be soldiers <br/>In an alien land, <br/>Chosen, called, and faithful, <br/>For our Captain’s band; <br/>In the service royal <br/>Let us not grow cold, <br/>Let us be right loyal,<br/>Noble, true, and bold. <br/>Master, Thou wilt keep us, <br/>By Thy grace divine, <br/>Always on the Lord’s side, <br/>Saviour, always Thine.</lines>
