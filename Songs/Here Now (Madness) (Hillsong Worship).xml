      <lines>HERE NOW (MADNESS)<br/>Words and Music by<br/>JOEL HOUSTON &amp;<br/>MICHAEL GUY CHISLETT<br/>VERSE 1<br/>Skies spin their dance within Your breath<br/>Time runs its race within Your hand<br/>And my mind runs wild to comprehend<br/>What no mind on earth could understand<br/>CHORUS<br/>Your ways are higher<br/>Your thoughts are wilder<br/>Love came like madness<br/>Poured out in blood wash romance<br/>It makes no sense but this is grace<br/>And I know You're with me in this place<br/>BRIDGE 1<br/>Here now, all I know is I know that You are<br/>Here now, still my heart, let Your voice be all I<br/>Hear now<br/>Spirit breathe like the wind come have Your way<br/>'Cause I know You're in this place<br/>VERSE 2<br/>Faith makes a fool of what makes sense<br/>But grace found my heart where logic ends<br/>When justice called for all my debts<br/>The friend of sinners came instead<br/>BRIDGE 2<br/>Here now, all I know is I know that You are<br/>Here now, still my heart, let Your voice be all I<br/>Hear now<br/>Spirit breathe like the wind come have Your way<br/>'Cause I know You are<br/>BRIDGE 3 (use BRIDGE 2 chords)<br/>Here now, heart and soul God I know that You are<br/>Here now, fix my eyes on the things that I can't<br/>See now, and all I see is the glory of Your Name<br/>'Cause I know that you are<br/>BRIDGE 4<br/>Here now, still my heart, let Your voice be all I<br/>Hear now, fix my eyes on the things that I can't<br/>See now, Spirit breathe like the wind<br/>Come have Your way</lines>
