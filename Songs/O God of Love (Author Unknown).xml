    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O God of love, I come to You again,<br/>Knowing I'll find mercy.<br/>I can't explain all the things I see,<br/>But I'll trust in You.<br/>In every moment You are there,<br/>Watching over You hear my prayer.<br/>You go before me, You're behind me,<br/>Nothing's hidden from You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How good it is to be loved by You,<br/>How good it is.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O God of strength,<br/>Your hand is on my life,<br/>Bringing peace to me.<br/>You know my frame,<br/>You know how I am made,<br/>You planned all my days.<br/>Hand of mercy, hand of love,<br/>Giving power to overcome.<br/>If all beneath me falls away,<br/>I know that You are God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Who can stand against us?<br/>In my weakness You are strong.<br/>Your word is everlasting,<br/>I will praise You, faithful One.</lines>
