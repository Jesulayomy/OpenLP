    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse 1:<br/>Sorrow is a lonely feeling<br/>Unsettled is a painful place<br/>I've lived with both for far too long now<br/>Since we've parted ways<br/>I've been wrestling with my conscience<br/>And I found myself to blame<br/>If there's to be any resolution<br/>I've got to peel my pride away</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Just between you and me<br/>I've got somethin' to say<br/>EbM7<br/>I wanna get it straight<br/>Before the sun goes down<br/>Just between you and me<br/>Confession needs to be made<br/>Recompense is my way to freedom (now)<br/>Just between you and me<br/>I've got something to say</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Verse 2:<br/>If confession is the road to healing<br/>Forgiveness is the promised land<br/>I'm reaching out in my conviction<br/>I'm longing to make amends<br/>So, I'm sorry for the words I've spoken<br/>For I've betrayed a friend<br/>We have a love that's worth preserving<br/>And a bond I will defend</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Just between you and me<br/>I've got somethin' to say<br/>EbM7<br/>I wanna get it straight<br/>Before the sun goes down<br/>Just Between you and me<br/>Confession needs to be made<br/>Recompense is my way to freedom (now)<br/>Just between you and me<br/>I've got something to say</lines>

    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>In my pursuit of God I thirst for holiness<br/>As I approach the Son I must consider this<br/>Offenses unresolved will keep me from the throne<br/>Before I go to him my wrong must be atoned<br/>Pre-Chorus<br/>If there's to be any resolution<br/>I've got to peel my pride away</lines>
