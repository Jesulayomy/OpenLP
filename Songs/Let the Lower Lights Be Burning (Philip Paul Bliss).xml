    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Brightly beams our Father's mercy from His lighthouse evermore,<br/>But to us He gives the keeping, of the lights along the shore<br/>Let the lower lights be burning! Send a gleam a cross the wave!<br/>For to us He gives the keeping of the lights along the shore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Dark the night of sin has settled, loud the angry billows roar.<br/>Eager eyes are watching, longing, for the lights, along the shore<br/>Let the lower lights be burning! Send a gleam a cross the wave!<br/>For to us He gives the keeping of the lights along the shore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Trim your feeble lamp, my brother, some poor sailor tempest tossed,<br/>Trying now to make the harbor, in the darkness may be lost.<br/>Let the lower lights be burning! Send a gleam a cross the wave!<br/>Trying now to make the harbor, some poor sailor may be lost.</lines>
