    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>From heaven You came, helpless babe,<br/>Entered our world, Your glory veiled;<br/>Not to be served but to serve,<br/>And give Your life that we might live.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>This is our God, the Servant King,<br/>He calls us now to follow Him,<br/>To bring our lives as a daily offering<br/>Of worship to  the Servant King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There in the garden of tears,<br/>My heavy load He chose to bear;<br/>His heart with sorrow was torn,<br/>'Yet not My will but Yours', He said.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Come see His hands and His feet,<br/>The scars that speak of sacrifice;<br/>Hands that flung stars into space<br/>To cruel nails surrendered.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So let us learn how to serve,<br/>And in our lives enthrone Him;<br/>Each other's needs to prefer,<br/>For it is Christ we're serving.</lines>
    </verse>
