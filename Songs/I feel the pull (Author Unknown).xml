    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>At night I laid in bed, and I began to cry<br/>And my mind just failed to know exactly why<br/>I can't explain with tongue or pen<br/>The Spirit is groaning deep within<br/>It must be God here in my soul<br/>Cause I feel the pull.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I feel the pull<br/>I hear the call<br/>And His Spirit's moving me<br/>To give my all<br/>He speaks to me<br/>And I agree<br/>Lord please come and take control<br/>I feel the pull</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I went to hear the Word<br/>And with each line and phrase<br/>Oh, He was drawing me to give a higher praise<br/>There is a deep, calling to the deep<br/>Like a great magnet pulling me<br/>I know for sure That I reach the goal<br/>Cause I feel the pull</lines>
    </verse>
