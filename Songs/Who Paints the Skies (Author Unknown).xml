    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who paints the skies into glorious day?<br/>Only the splendour of Jesus.<br/>Who breathes His life into fists of clay?<br/>Only the splendour of Jesus.<br/>Who shapes the valleys and brings the rain?<br/>Only the splendour of Jesus.<br/>Who makes the desert to live again?<br/>Only the splendour of Jesus.<br/>Teach every nation His marvellous ways;<br/>Each generation shall sing His praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He is wonderful, He is glorious,<br/>Clothed in righteousness, full of tenderness.<br/>Come and worship Him,<br/>He's the Prince of life,<br/>He will cleanse our hearts In His river of fire.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who hears the cry of the barren one?<br/>Only the mercy of Jesus.<br/>Who breaks the curse of the heart of stone?<br/>Only the mercy of Jesus.<br/>Who storms the prison and sets men free,<br/>Only the mercy of Jesus.<br/>Purchasing souls for eternity?<br/>Only the mercy of Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
