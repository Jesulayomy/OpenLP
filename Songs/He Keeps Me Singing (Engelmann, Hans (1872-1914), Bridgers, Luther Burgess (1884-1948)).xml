  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's within my heart a melody<br/>Jesus whispers sweet and low:<br/>"Fear not I am with thee. Peace be still."<br/>In all of life's ebb and flow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All my life was wrecked by sin and strife;<br/>Discord filled my heart with pain.<br/>Jesus swept across the broken strings;<br/>Stirred the slumb'ring chords again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Feasting in the riches of His grace;<br/>Resting neath His shelt'ring wing.<br/>Always looking on His smiling face:<br/>That is why I shout and sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Though sometimes He leads through waters deep,<br/>Trials fall across the way;<br/>Though sometimes the path seems rough and steep;<br/>I see His footprints all the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Soon He's coming back to welcome me<br/>Far beyond the starry sky.<br/>I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown;<br/>I shall reign with Him on high.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Jesus, Jesus, Jesus;<br/>Sweetest name I know.<br/>Fills my every longing;<br/>Keeps me singing as I go.</lines>
    </verse>
