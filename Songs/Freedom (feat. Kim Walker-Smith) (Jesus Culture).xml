      <lines>Verse:<br/>Step out of the shadows, step out of the grave<br/>Break into the wild and don't be afraid<br/>Run into wide open spaces<br/>Grace is waiting for you<br/>Dance like the weight has been lifted<br/>Grace is waiting</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom, there is freedom<br/>Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom, there is freedom<br/>Come out of the dark, just as you are<br/>Into the fullness of His love<br/>The Spirit is here, let there be freedom<br/>Let there be freedom</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse:<br/>Bring all of your burdens, bring all of your scars<br/>Come back to communion, come back to the start<br/>Run into wide open spaces<br/>Grace is waiting for you<br/>Dance like the weight has been lifted<br/>Grace is waiting</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>Chains will fall, prisons shake<br/>At the sound of Jesus' name<br/>Lives made whole, hearts awake<br/>At the sound of Jesus' name</lines>
