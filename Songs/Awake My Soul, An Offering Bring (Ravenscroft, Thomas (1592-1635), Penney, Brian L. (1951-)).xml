    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Awake my soul, an off'ring bring to Jesus our exalted King; Sing to Him Who reigns above incarnate fount of grace and love; Sing to Him Who reigns above incarnate fount of grace and love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In awe we stand upon this ground, His wisdom and His pow'r astound; All His wonders we behold, in heav'n and earth His story's told; All His wonders we behold, in heav'n and earth His story's told.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Then to this world, behold what grace! He comes to rescue Adam's race; Our Redeemer, our High Priest, from sin and death He brings release; Our Redeemer, our High Priest, from sin and death He brings release.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Awake my soul, arise and sing, eternal praise to Christ our King; In His Church, His Name confessed, we worship Him among the blessed; In His Church, His Name confessed, we worship Him among the blessed.</lines>
