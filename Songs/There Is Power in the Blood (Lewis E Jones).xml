    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Would you be free from your passion and pride<br/>There's power in the blood, power in the blood<br/>Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide<br/>There's wonderful power in the blood</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Would you be whiter much whiter than snow<br/>There's power in the blood, power in the blood<br/>Sin stains are lost in its life giving flow<br/>There's wonderful power in the blood</lines>
    </verse>

      <lines>Would you do service for Jesus your King<br/>There's power in the blood, power in the blood<br/>Would you live daily His praises to sing<br/>There's wonderful power in the blood</lines>
