    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The law of God is good and wise, And sets His will before our eyes, Shows us the way of righteousness, And dooms to death when we transgress.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Its light of holiness imparts The knowledge of our sinful hearts, That we may see our lost estate And seek deliv'rance ere too late.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>To those who help in Christ have found And would in works of love abound It shows what deeds are His delight And should be done as good and right.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When men the offered help disdain And willfully in sin remain, Its terror in their ear resounds And keeps their wickedness in bounds.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>The law is good, but since the fall Its holiness condemns us all; It dooms us for our sin to die And has no pow'r to justify.</lines>
    </verse>
