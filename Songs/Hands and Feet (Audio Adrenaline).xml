    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>An image flashed across my TV screen.<br/>Another broken heart comes into view.<br/>I saw the pain, and I turned my back.<br/>Why can't I do the things I want to?<br/>I am willing, yet I'm so afraid; You give me strength when I say...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I want to be Your hands. I want to be Your feet.<br/>I'll go where You send me, go where You send me.<br/>I want to be Your hands, I want to be Your feet.<br/>I'll go where You send me, go where You send me<br/>And I'll try, yeah I'll try to touch the world, like You touched my life,<br/>And I'll find my way to be Your hands.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I've abandoned every selfish thought; I've surrendered everything I've got.<br/>You can have everything I am and perfect everything I'm not.<br/>I am willing, I'm not afraid. You give me strength when I say</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>This is the last time I turn my back from You.<br/>From now on I'll go out, send me where You want me to.<br/>I finally have a mission, I promise I'll complete.<br/>I don't need excuses when I am your hands and feet.</lines>
    </verse>
