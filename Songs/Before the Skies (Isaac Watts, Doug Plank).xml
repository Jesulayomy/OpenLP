    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Though His glories still proceed<br/>Never changing from our Lord<br/>He laid down His majesty<br/>And took on human form<br/>Mortals here beheld His face<br/>The Heav'nly Father's perfect Son<br/>Full of truth and full of grace<br/>The Savior now has come!</lines>
