    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You came down, from heaven's throne<br/>This earth You formed, was not Your home<br/>A love like this, the world had never known<br/>A crown of thorns, to mock your name<br/>Forgiveness fell upon Your face<br/>A love like this, the world had never known</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>On the altar of our praise<br/>Let there be no higher name<br/>Jesus Son of God<br/>You laid down Your perfect life<br/>You are the sacrifice<br/>Jesus Son of God<br/>You are Jesus Son of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You took our sin<br/>You bore our shame<br/>You rose to life<br/>You defeated the grave<br/>A love like this, the world has never known</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Be lifted higher<br/>Than all You've overcome<br/>Your name be louder<br/>Than any other song<br/>There is no power<br/>That can come against Your love<br/>The cross was enough<br/>The cross was enough</lines>
