    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A tender blade of grass so green<br/>Crushed in the footprint of the Nazarene<br/>Sprang back and waved a message to a bird on the wing<br/>That's Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In a mighty old river in the noonday sun<br/>An outcast kept crying, «I tell you He's the One»<br/>A voice out of Heaven said, «I'm pleased with My Son»<br/>That's Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>That's Him, He's Sharon's rose<br/>That's Him, our Morning Star that glows<br/>He's Alpha, Omega, the beginning and the end<br/>That's Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Angry waves splashing everywhere<br/>He's asleep in the boat, does He even care?<br/>We're all so afraid, He just keeps lying there<br/>That's Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Then He raised His hands above His head<br/>Said, «Peace, be still» and the water fled<br/>A wave tapped the wind on the shoulder and said, «Shh, that's Him»<br/>That's Him, that's Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>There'll be two at work in a field one day<br/>One will be left, the other called away<br/>One falls to his knees, «It's too late» he'll say<br/>'Cause that's Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>With one foot on the sea and one on the shore<br/>Declaring the time, it will never be anymore<br/>The trumpet will shout like never before<br/>That's Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>That's Him, He's Sharon's rose, that's Him<br/>Our Morning Star that glows<br/>He's Alpha, Omega, beginning and the end<br/>That's Him<br/>He's Alpha, Omega, the beginning and the end<br/>That's Him, that's Him</lines>
    </verse>
