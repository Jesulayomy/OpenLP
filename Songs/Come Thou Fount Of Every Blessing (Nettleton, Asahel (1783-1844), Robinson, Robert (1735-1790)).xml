    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come, Thou fount of every blessing, Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;<br/>Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise.<br/>Teach me some melodious sonnet, Sung by flaming tongues above;<br/>Praise His name, I'm fixed upon it, name of God's redeeming love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Hitherto Thy love has blest me; Thou hast brought me to this place,<br/>And I know Thy hand will bring me Safely home by Thy good grace.<br/>Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God;<br/>He to rescue me from danger, Bought me with His precious blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Here I raise mine Ebenezer; Hither by Thy help I come,<br/>And I hope, by Thy good pleasure, Safely to arrive at home.<br/>Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God;<br/>He to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh, to grace how great a debtor, Daily I'm constrained to be;<br/>Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, Bind my wandering heart to Thee.<br/>Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love.<br/>Here's my heart, oh take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Praise His name, I'm fixed upon it, name of God's redeeming love.</lines>
