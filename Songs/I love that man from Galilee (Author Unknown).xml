    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In a manger long ago, I know it's really so,<br/>A Babe was born to save men from their sin.<br/>John saw Him on the shore, the Lamb forevermore,<br/>Oh, the Christ, the Crucified of Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh, I love that Man from Galilee,<br/>For He's done so very much for me.<br/>He's forgiven all my sins, placed the Holy Ghost within;<br/>Oh, I love that man from Galilee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The publican went to pray in the temple there one day,<br/>He cried, "O Lord be merciful to me!"<br/>He was forgiven of every sin, and a deep peace placed within;<br/>He said, "Come see this Man from Galilee."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The lame was made to walk, the dumb was made to talk,<br/>That power was spoken with love upon the sea;<br/>The blind was made to see, I know it could only be<br/>The mercy of that Man from Galilee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Nicodemus came by night, to know the way of right,<br/>He asked the Son of Man what must he do.<br/>These words He said to him, "Ye must be born again,"<br/>By the Spirit of that Man from Galilee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>The woman at the well, He all her sins did tell,<br/>How five husbands she had at that time,<br/>She was forgiven of every sin, and a deep peace came within;<br/>Then she cried, "Come see that Man from Galilee!"</lines>
