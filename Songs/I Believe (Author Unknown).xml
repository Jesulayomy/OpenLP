      <lines>2 verse<br/>Woman with child and an inn with no room<br/>Born in a manger foretelling a tomb<br/>This is how the story goes</lines>

    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Precious Lord, how can it be that<br/>God's great plan for history<br/>Would send you to the lonely tree<br/>That you would come for one like me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>LastI believe in a cross<br/>I believe he came for one, he came for all<br/>The Son of God, the Great I Am<br/>Gave his life for me and then He rose again<br/>I believe, I believe, oh I believe<br/>Jesus lives in me, I believe</lines>
