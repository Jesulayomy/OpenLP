      <lines>Bring them from the west, sons and daughters,<br/>Call them for Your praise.<br/>Gather from the east all Your children,<br/>Coming home again.<br/>Bring them from afar, all the nations,<br/>From the north and south,<br/>drawing all the peoples in.<br/>Corners of the earth,<br/>come to see there's<br/>only one Saviour and King</lines>
