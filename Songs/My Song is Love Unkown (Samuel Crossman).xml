    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My song is love unknown,<br/>My Saviour’s love to me: <br/>Love to the loveless shown, <br/>That they might lovely be. <br/>O who am I, that for my sake <br/>My Lord should take frail flesh and die?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He came from His blessed throne,<br/>Salvation to bestow; <br/>But men made strange, and none <br/>The longed-for Christ would know: <br/>But O! my Friend, my Friend indeed, <br/>Who at my need His life did spend.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sometimes they strew His way, <br/>And His sweet praises sing; <br/>Resounding all the day <br/>Hosannas to their King: <br/>Then ‘Crucify!’ is all their breath, <br/>And for His death they thirst and cry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>They rise and needs will have <br/>My dear Lord made away; <br/>A murderer they save, <br/>The Prince of life they slay, <br/>Yet cheerful He to suffering goes, <br/>That He His foes from thence might free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>In life no house, no home <br/>My Lord on earth might have; <br/>In death, no friendly tomb, <br/>But what a stranger gave. <br/>What may I say? Heaven was His home; <br/>And mine the tomb wherein He lay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Here might I stay and sing, <br/>No story so divine; <br/>Never was love, dear King! <br/>Never was grief like Thine. <br/>This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise <br/>I all my days could gladly spend.</lines>
    </verse>
