  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I was an orphan, lost at the fall<br/>Running away when I'd hear You call<br/>But Father, You worked Your will<br/>I had no righteousness of my own<br/>I had no right to draw near Your throne<br/>But Father, You loved me still</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And in love, before You laid the world's foundation<br/>You predestined to adopt me as Your own<br/>You have raised me up so high above my station<br/>I'm a child of God by grace, and grace alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You left Your home to seek out the lost<br/>You knew the great and terrible cost<br/>But Jesus, Your face was set<br/>I worked my fingers down to the bone<br/>But nothing I did could ever atone<br/>But Jesus, You paid my debt</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>By Your blood I have redemption and salvation<br/>Lord You died that I might reap what You have sown<br/>And You rose that I might be a new creation<br/>I am born again by grace, and grace alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I was in darkness all of my life<br/>I never knew the day from the night<br/>But Spirit, You made me see<br/>I swore I knew the way on my own<br/>Head full of rocks, a heart made of stone<br/>But Spirit, You moved in me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>And At Your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened<br/>On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone<br/>Called into a Kingdom that cannot shaken<br/>Heaven's citizen by grace, and grace alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>So I'll stand in faith by grace, and grace alone<br/>I will run the race by grace, and grace alone<br/>I will slay my sin by grace, and grace alone<br/>I will reach the end by grace, and grace alone</lines>
    </verse>
