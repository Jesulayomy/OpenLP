    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God's attributes were manifested<br/>to His Bride in this last age,<br/>We have caught the revelation<br/>By the last prophet's message;<br/>And we know who we are<br/>And what we are raised up for,<br/>Praise the Lord for the Original Life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>The Original Life, the Original Seed,<br/>The Original Word is what I believe;<br/>The Son of Man is revealed,<br/>The Seventh Seal is unveiled,<br/>The Original Life, the Original Seed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We are the Word made flesh today,<br/>This is what the Scriptures say;<br/>And our names are seen within,<br/>Redeemed and perfect without sin;<br/>Yes, we are anointed and inspired<br/>By our God, Who's the Original Life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Our eyes of understanding<br/>He has opened up at last,<br/>And sweet victory is ours<br/>Who were chained down in the past;<br/>True Jubilee has sounded<br/>And we have responded<br/>To our God, Who's the Original Life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We are called unto adoption,<br/>Full authority and power;<br/>Sleeping saints will wake and join us<br/>For translation in this hour.<br/>Gentiles' days soon will be over,<br/>Glory, hallelujah!<br/>To our God, Who's the Original Life.</lines>
