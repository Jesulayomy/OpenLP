    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My soul shall magnify the Lord, And with my spirit I rejoice; My Savior has regard for me, He hears His lowly servant's voice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Behold, I am forever blessed, For God has done great things for me; His mercy rests on those who fear, Who honor His Name most holy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Lord has shown His mighty arm, Those proud in heart He shall put down; The haughty from their thrones removed, The lowly have God's blessing found.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The hungry with good things are filled, They see God's kindness ev'ry day; But on the rich no blessing rests, With empty hands they're sent away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>The Lord helps His beloved ones, In mercy He His cov'nant keeps; Just as He promised long ago, to Abraham, and to his Seed.</lines>
    </verse>
