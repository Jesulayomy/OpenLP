  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>What a friend we have in Jesus, All ours sins and griefs to bear;<br/>What a privilege to carry, Everything to God in prayer!<br/>O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear;<br/>All because we do not carry, Everything to God in prayer!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?<br/>We should never be discouraged, Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>Can we find a friend so faithful? Who will all our sorrows share?<br/>Jesus knows our every weakness; Take it to the Lord in prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Are we weak and heavy laden, Cumbered with a load of care?<br/>Precious Saviour still our refuge; Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>Do thy friends despise forsake thee? Take it to the Lord in prayer!<br/>In His arms He'll take and shield thee; Thou wilt find a solace there.</lines>
    </verse>
