      <lines>Chorus:<br/>I'm gonna run and not grow weary<br/>I'm gonna walk and not grow faint<br/>Rise up on wings like eagles<br/>To soar<br/>I know with everything you're with me<br/>I know you're working as I wait<br/>Lift me up on wings like eagles<br/>To soar</lines>

      <lines>Verse 2:<br/>This desert holds a song I will sing, on and on<br/>You're a river when the ground I walk is dry<br/>You will set the crooked straight, clear my path, make a way<br/>You will lead me from the valley to the heights<br/>As I wait, As I wait on You</lines>

      <lines>Bridge:<br/>Creator, Keeper, Life-breather<br/>Your name is greater than anything I've faced<br/>Sustainter, Savior, Stronghold-breaker<br/>Your name is greater than anything I've faced<br/>As I wait, as I wait on You<br/>I will wait, God, I will wait on You</lines>
