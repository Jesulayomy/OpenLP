    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse 1:<br/>Every time I think of Your name<br/>Of Your love, that I can't explain<br/>Why You died for us, Jesus Christ?<br/>I want to understand: who You are?<br/>I want to know: what is Your love?<br/>My life is like a night, I need Your light!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Here love is impossible, but You loved me!<br/>This is so incredible - your love to me!<br/>I am insignificant, but even when<br/>Whole world was invisible, you were, You were with me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse 2:<br/>Every time I searched for Your face<br/>Your forgiveness and Your grace<br/>You were by my side - freedom for my mind<br/>Now I understand who You are<br/>Now I know, what is Your love<br/>You are in my heart Son of God</lines>
