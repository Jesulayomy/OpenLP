    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus has a table spread where the saints<br/>of God are fed,<br/>He invites His chosen people "Come and<br/>me;"<br/>With His manna He doth feed and<br/>supplies our every need;<br/>O, 'tis sweet to sup with Jesus all the<br/>time!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>CHORUS<br/>"Come and dine," the Master calleth,<br/>"Come and dine;"<br/>You may feast at Jesus' table all the<br/>time;<br/>He who fed the multitude, turned the<br/>water into wine,<br/>To the hungry calleth now, "Come and<br/>dine."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The disciples came to land, thus obeying<br/>Christ's command,<br/>For the Master called to them, "Come<br/>and dine;"<br/>There they found their hearts' desire,<br/>bread and fish upon the fire;<br/>Thus He satisfies the hungry every time.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Soon the Lamb will take His bride to<br/>be ever at His side,<br/>All the host of heaven will assembled be;<br/>O, 'twill be a glorious sight, all the<br/>saints in spotless white;<br/>And with Jesus they will feast eternally.</lines>
