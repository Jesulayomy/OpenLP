      <lines>You are not a God<br/>Created by human hands<br/>You are not a god<br/>Dependent on any mortal man<br/>You are not a god<br/>In need of anything we can give<br/>By Your plan, that's just the way it is</lines>

      <lines>You're the only God whose power<br/>none can contend<br/>You're the only God<br/>Whose name and praise will never end<br/>You're the only God<br/>Who's worthy of everything we can give<br/>You are God<br/>And that's just the way it is</lines>
