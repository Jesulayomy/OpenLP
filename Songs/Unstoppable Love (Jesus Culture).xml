    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse: 1<br/>Try to stop Your love and You would wage a war<br/>Try to take the very thing You gave Your life for<br/>You would come running  tear down every wall<br/>All the while You're shouting  "My Love, you're worth it all".</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>God you pursue me with power and glory<br/>Unstoppable Love that never ends<br/>You're unrelenting with passion and mercy<br/>Unstoppable Love that never ends</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse: 2<br/>You broke into the silence and sang a song of hope<br/>A melody, a sound in the deep of my soul<br/>You have come running You tore down every wall<br/>All the while you're shouting, "My Love you're worth it all"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>No sin, no shame, no past, no pain<br/>Can separate me from Your love<br/>No height, no depth, no fear, no death<br/>Can separate me from Your love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Try to stop Your love and You would wage a war</lines>
