    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Verse: 1<br/>It's already been done You can't add to His blood<br/>It was once for all the Father gave His Son<br/>Forever we are changed by the miracle of grace<br/>Throughout history the Father's light remains</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Praises rise, endlessly<br/>We lay our lives before the King<br/>Who was, who is His love will always be<br/>The hope for all eternity</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Verse: 2<br/>We've only just begun to see all of heaven come<br/>Every fear will bow at the Father's perfect love<br/>Your Kingdom is at hand and the gates of hell won't stand<br/>Now in victory we lift our song again</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>Open up the doors<br/>We are ready we are ready<br/>Crying out for more<br/>In Your presence we come alive</lines>
