    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>For all the saints, who from their labors rest, Who Thee by faith before the world confessed, Thy Name, O Jesus, be forever blessed. Alleluia, Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress and their Might; Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well fought fight; Thou, in the darkness drear, their one true Light. Alleluia, Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For the Apostles' glorious company, Who bearing forth the Cross o'er land and sea, Shook all the mighty world, we sing to Thee: Alleluia, Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For the Evangelists, by whose blest word, Like fourfold streams, the garden of the Lord, Is fair and fruitful, be Thy Name adored. Alleluia, Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>For Martyrs, who with rapture kindled eye, Saw the bright crown descending from the sky, And seeing, grasped it, Thee we glorify. Alleluia, Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>O blest communion, fellowship divine! We feebly struggle, they in glory shine; All are one in Thee, for all are Thine. Alleluia, Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold, Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old, And win with them the victor's crown of gold. Alleluia, Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long, Steals on the ear the distant triumph song, And hearts are brave, again, and arms are strong. Alleluia, Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>The golden evening brightens in the west; Soon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest; Sweet is the calm of paradise the blessed. Alleluia, Alleluia!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day; The saints triumphant rise in bright array; The King of glory passes on His way. Alleluia, Alleluia!</lines>
