    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The cross before me, the world behind.<br/>No turning back, raise the banner high.<br/>It's not for me; it's all for You.<br/>Let the heavens shake and split the sky.<br/>Let the people clap their hands and cry.<br/>It's not for us; it's all for You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Not to us, but to Your name  be the glory.<br/>Not to us, but to Your name  be the glory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Our hearts unfold before Your throne.<br/>The only place for those who know:<br/>It's not for us; it's all for You.<br/>Send Your holy fire on this offering.<br/>Let our worship burn for the world to see.<br/>It's not for us; it's all for You, for You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>The earth is shaking, the mountains shouting;<br/>It's all for You.<br/>The waves are crashing, the sun is raging;<br/>It's all for You.<br/>The universe is spinning and singing;<br/>It's all for You<br/>Your children dancing, dancing, dancing;<br/>It's all for You; it's all for You.</lines>
