    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come see the beauty of the Lord, (echo)<br/>Come see the beauty of His face. (echo)<br/>See the Lamb that once was slain, (echo)<br/>See on His palms is carved your name. (echo)<br/>See how our pain has pierced His heart, (echo)<br/>And on His brow He bears our pride; (echo)<br/>A crown of thorns.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>But only love pours from His heart, (echo)<br/>As silently He takes the blame. (echo)<br/>He has my name upon His lips, (echo)<br/>My condemnation falls on Him. (echo)<br/>This love is marvellous to me, (echo)<br/>His sacrifice has set me free (echo)<br/>And now I live!</lines>
