    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Abide with me, fast falls the eventide;<br/>The darkness deepens, Lord, with me abide;<br/>When other helpers fail and comforts flee,<br/>Help of the helpless, O abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;<br/>Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;<br/>Change and decay in all around I see;<br/>O Thou who changest not, abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I need Thy presence every passing hour;<br/>What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?<br/>Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?<br/>Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;<br/>Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.<br/>Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory? <br/>I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Reveal Thyself before my closing eyes;<br/>Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies,<br/>Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;<br/>In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
