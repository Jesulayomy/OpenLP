  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I once was lost in darkest night yet thought I knew the way<br/>The sin that promised joy and life had led me to the grave<br/>I had no hope that you would own a rebel to your will<br/>And if you had not loved me first I would refuse you still</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>But as I ran my hell-bound race indifferent to the cost<br/>You looked upon my helpless state and led me to the cross<br/>And I beheld Gods love displayed you suffered in my place<br/>You bore the wrath reserved for me now all I know is grace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Hallelujah all I have is Christ Hallelujah Jesus is my life<br/>Hallelujah all I have is Christ Hallelujah Jesus is my life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now Lord I would be yours alone and live so all might see<br/>The strength to follow your commands could never come from me<br/>O father use my ransomed life in any way you choose<br/>And let my song forever be my only boast is you</lines>
