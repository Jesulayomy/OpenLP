  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You thought of us before the world began to breathe.<br/>You knew our names before we came to be.<br/>You saw the very day we'd fall away from you,<br/>And how desperately we need to be redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>Lord Jesus, come lead us;<br/>We're desperate for your touch.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh Great and Mighty One, with one desire we come,<br/>That you would reign, that you would reign in us.<br/>We're offering up our lives, a living sacrifice,<br/>That you would reign, that you would reign in us.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Spirit of the Living God, fall fresh again,<br/>Come search our hearts and purify our lives.<br/>We need your perfect love;<br/>We need your discipline.<br/>We're lost unless you guide us with your light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>We cry out for your love to refine us,<br/>Cry out for your love to define us,<br/>Cry out for your mercy to keep us<br/>blameless until You return.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b2">
      <lines>So reign, please reign in us.<br/>Come purify our hearts; we need your touch.<br/>Come cleanse us like a flood and send us out<br/>So the world may know you reign, you reign in us.</lines>
    </verse>
