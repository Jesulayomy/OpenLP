    <verse name="b2">
      <lines>Bridge:<br/>And you made yourself nothing for us<br/>And you gave up your life for the least of men<br/>You entered the gates of death<br/>And rose with the keys in your hand</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Middle 8:<br/>There is no one like You<br/>There is none besides You</lines>
