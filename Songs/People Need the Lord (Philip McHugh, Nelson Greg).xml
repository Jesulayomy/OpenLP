  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Everyday they pass me by I can see it in their eyes<br/>Empty people filled with care Headed who knows where<br/>On they go through private pain living fear to fear<br/>Laughter hides their silent cries only Jesus hears</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>People need the Lord, people need the Lord<br/>At the end of broken dreams, He's the open door<br/>People need the Lord, people need the Lord<br/>When will we realize people need the Lord?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We are called to take His light to a world where wrong seems right<br/>What could be too great a cost for sharing life with one who's lost?<br/>Through His love our hearts can feel all the grief they bear<br/>They must hear the words of life only we can share</lines>
    </verse>
