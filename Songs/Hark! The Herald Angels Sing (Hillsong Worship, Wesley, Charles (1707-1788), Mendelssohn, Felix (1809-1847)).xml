  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hark, the herald angels sing, glory to the new born King.<br/>Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.<br/>Joyful all ye nations rise, join the trumpets of the skies,<br/>With angelic hosts proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem,<br/>Hark, the herald angels sing, glory to the new born King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Christ by highest heaven adored, Christ the everlasting Lord.<br/>Late in time behold Him come, offspring of a virgin's womb<br/>Veiled in flesh the Godhead see, hail the incarnate Deity.<br/>Pleased as man with man to dwell, Jesus our Emmanuel,<br/>Hark, the herald angels sing, glory to the new born King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Hail the heaven born Prince of peace, hail the Son of righteousness,<br/>Light and life to all He brings, risen with healing in His wings.<br/>Mild He lays His glory by, born that man no more may die,<br/>Born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth,<br/>Hark, the herald angels sing, glory to the new born King.</lines>
    </verse>
