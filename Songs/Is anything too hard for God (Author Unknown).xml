      <lines>It's out of your hands,<br/>you've done all you can do.<br/>You've given God the problem,<br/>It's no longer up to you.<br/>You've prayed the prayer of faith,<br/>you're standing on God's truth.<br/>While you're waiting on the answer,<br/>He has a question for you.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Only believe,<br/>trust His Word, You'll see<br/>His plans are now unfolding,<br/>performing perfectly.<br/>It's clear how much He loves you,<br/>look at all He's done.<br/>For all your questions, there's really only one.</lines>
