    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You should see the stars tonight,<br/>How they shimmer, shine so bright.<br/>Against the black, they look so white,<br/>Coming down from such a height<br/>To reach me now; You reach me now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You should see the moon in flight,<br/>Cutting 'cross the misty night,<br/>Softly dancing in sunshine.<br/>Reflections of it's light<br/>Reach me now; You reach me now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And how could such a thing<br/>shine it's light on me<br/>And make ev'rything<br/>beautiful again?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You should feel the sun in spring,<br/>Coming out after a rain.<br/>Suddenly, all is green,<br/>Sunshine on ev'rything.<br/>I can feel it now; I feel You now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>You should hear the angels sing,<br/>All gathered 'round their King,<br/>More beautiful than you could dream.<br/>I've been quietly listening.<br/>You can hear them now; I hear them now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>And how could such a King<br/>shine His light on me<br/>And make ev'rything<br/>beautiful again?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>And how could such a King shine His light on me<br/>And make ev'rything beautiful?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I want to shine; I want to be light.<br/>I want to tell You, 'it'll be alright.'<br/>And I want to shine, and I want to fly,<br/>Just to tell You, 'now it'll be alright.'<br/>It'll be alright; It'll be alright.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b2">
      <lines>'Cause I've got nothing of my own to give to You.<br/>But this light that shines on me shines on You<br/>And makes ev'rything beautiful again.<br/>It'll be alright; It'll be alright.</lines>
    </verse>
