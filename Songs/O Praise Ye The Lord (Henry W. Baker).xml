    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O praise ye the Lord!<br/>Praise Him in the height; <br/>Rejoice in His word, <br/>Ye angels of light; <br/>Ye heavens adore Him <br/>By whom ye were made, <br/>And worship before Him<br/>In brightness arrayed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O praise ye the Lord! <br/>Praise Him upon earth, <br/>In tuneful accord, <br/>Ye sons of new birth; <br/>Praise Him who hath brought you <br/>His grace from above, <br/>Praise Him who hath taught you <br/>To sing of His love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O praise ye the Lord, <br/>All things that give sound; <br/>Each jubilant chord, <br/>Re-echo around: <br/>Loud organs, His glory <br/>Forthtell in deep tone, <br/>And sweet harp, the story <br/>Of what He hath done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O praise ye the Lord! <br/>Thanksgiving and song <br/>To Him be outpoured <br/>All ages along; <br/>For love in creation, <br/>For heaven restored, <br/>For grace of salvation, <br/>O praise ye the Lord!</lines>
