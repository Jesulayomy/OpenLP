    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a pageant of triumph in glory,<br/>As Jesus the King takes His throne.<br/>The shame of the cross is exchanged for a crown,<br/>And heaven applauds the King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Son has the Father's approval,<br/>He perfectly followed the plan<br/>To suffer and die for the sins of the world,<br/>He poured out His love for our shame.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Let God arise with shouts of joy,<br/>With songs of praise and trumpet sound;<br/>Let music play and hearts be free,<br/>Let God arise!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Death could not keep Him in prison,<br/>He burst through the shackles of hell;<br/>He settled the score with the evil one,<br/>And heaven applauds the King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The fullness of Christ is my treasure,<br/>I've cast off the past with its shame.<br/>The power of the Father has raised me to life,<br/>I'm a son, I'm forgiven and free.</lines>
    </verse>
