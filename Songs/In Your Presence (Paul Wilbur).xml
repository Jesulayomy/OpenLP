    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In Your presence that's where I am strong, in Your presence O Lord My God<br/>In Your presence that's where I belong, seeking Your face, touching Your grace<br/>In the cleft of the Rock, in Your presence O God!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I want to go where the rivers cannot overflow me<br/>Where my feet are on the Rock<br/>I want to hide where the blazing fires cannot burn me<br/>In Your presence O God!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I want to hide where the flood of evil cannot reach me<br/>Where I'm covered by the Blood<br/>I want to be where the schemes of darkness<br/>Cannot touch me, in Your presence O God!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You are my firm foundation, I trust in You all day long<br/>I am Your child and Your servant and<br/>You are my strength and my song, You're my song</lines>
