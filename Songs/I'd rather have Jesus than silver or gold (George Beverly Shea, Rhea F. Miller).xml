    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold;<br/>I'd rather be His than have riches untold;<br/>I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.<br/>I'd rather be led by His nail pierced hand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Than to be the king of a vast domain<br/>Or be held in sin's dread sway.<br/>I'd rather have Jesus than anything<br/>This world affords today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause;<br/>I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause;<br/>I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame.<br/>I'd rather be true to His holy name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;<br/>He's sweeter than honey from out the comb;<br/>He's all that my hungering spirit needs.<br/>I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead</lines>
