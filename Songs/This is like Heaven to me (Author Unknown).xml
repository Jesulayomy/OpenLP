    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We find many people who can't<br/>understand, why we are<br/>so happy and free;<br/>We've crossed over Jordan<br/>to Canaan's fair land,<br/>And this is like Heaven to me.</lines>

      <lines>CHORUS:<br/>Oh, this is like Heaven to me, (Praise God!)<br/>Yes, this is like Heaven to me;<br/>I've crossed over Jordan<br/>to Canaan's fair land,<br/>And this is like Heaven to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh, when I get happy,<br/>I sing and I shout,<br/>the devil don't believe It, I see;<br/>But I'm filled with the Spirit,<br/>there isn't a doubt,<br/>And that's what's the matter with me.</lines>
