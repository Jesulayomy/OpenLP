    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>To shepherds as they watched by night Appeared a host of angels bright; Behold the tender Babe, they said, In yonder lowly manger laid.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>At Bethlehem, in David's town, As Micah did of old make known; 'Tis Jesus Christ, your Lord and King, Who doth to all salvation bring.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, then rejoice that through His Son God is with sinners now at one; Made like yourselves of flesh and blood, Your Brother is th'eternal God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>What harm can sin and death then do? The true God now abides with you. Let hell and Satan rage and chafe, Christ is your Brother ye are safe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Not one He will or can forsake Who Him his confidence doth make. Let all his wiles the Tempter try, You may his utmost pow'rs defy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Ye shall and must at last prevail;<br/>God's own ye are, ye cannot fail.<br/>To God forever sing your praise<br/>With joy and patience all your days.</lines>
    </verse>
