      <lines>Here and now I'm in the fire,<br/>In above my head<br/>Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh<br/>Being held under the pressure,<br/>Don't know what'll be left<br/>Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh<br/>But it's here in the ashes<br/>I'm finding treasure</lines>

      <lines>He's making diamonds, diamonds<br/>Making diamonds out of dust<br/>He is refining in his timing<br/>He's making diamonds out of us</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'll surrender to the power<br/>Of being crushed by love<br/>Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh<br/>Till the beauty that was hidden<br/>Isn't covered up<br/>Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh<br/>Oh it's not what I hoped for<br/>It's something much better</lines>

      <lines>Oh the joy of the Lord<br/>It will be my strength<br/>When the pressure is on<br/>He's making diamonds<br/>Oh the joy of the Lord<br/>It will be my strength<br/>When the pressure is on<br/>He's making diamonds<br/>Oh the joy of the Lord<br/>It will be my strength<br/>When the pressure is on<br/>He's making, he's making</lines>

      <lines>I won't be afraid to shine<br/>I won't be afraid to shine<br/>I won't be afraid to shine<br/>Cause he's making diamonds out of dust<br/>Making diamonds out of usï»¿</lines>
