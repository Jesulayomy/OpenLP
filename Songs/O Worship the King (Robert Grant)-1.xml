    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O worship the King,<br/>All glorious above; <br/>O gratefully sing <br/>His power and His love: <br/>Our Shield and Defender, <br/>The Ancient of Days, <br/>Pavilioned in splendour <br/>And girded with praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O tell of His might, <br/>O sing of His grace, <br/>Whose robe is the light, <br/>Whose canopy space; <br/>His chariots of wrath <br/>The deep thunder-clouds form, <br/>And dark is His path <br/>On the wings of the storm.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The earth, with its store <br/>Of wonders untold, <br/>Almighty, Thy power <br/>Hath founded of old; <br/>Hath â€™stablished it fast, <br/>By a changeless decree, <br/>And round it hath cast, <br/>Like a mantle, the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thy bountiful care <br/>What tongue can recite? <br/>It breathes in the air, <br/>It shines in the light; <br/>It streams from the hills, <br/>It descends to the plain, <br/>And sweetly distils <br/>In the dew and the rain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Frail children of dust, <br/>And feeble as frail, <br/>In Thee do we trust, <br/>Nor find Thee to fail; <br/>Thy mercies how tender, <br/>How firm to the end, <br/>Our Maker, Defender, <br/>Redeemer, and Friend!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>O measureless might!<br/>Ineffable love!<br/>While angels delight<br/>To the hymn above,<br/>The humble creation<br/>Though feeble their lays,<br/>With true adoration<br/>Shall sing to their praise.</lines>
    </verse>
