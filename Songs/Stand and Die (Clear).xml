    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Steadfast Stephen saw his chance to open wide unveiling lies;<br/>Delivering his skin and bones upon the hate-filled battle cries;<br/>They rushed him and they stoned him, but his sights were set on the open skies.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I'm in the wake of martyrs gone before me waiting to be tried;<br/>Is the strength and trust I have in You enough that I would stand and die?<br/>Stand and die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Caught in Cassie was a candle burning from the wick of life;<br/>She had found it when she finally turned to You, that graceful night;<br/>When they asked her if she knew You, what else could she reply?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Now it's nearly twenty hundred years since You were crucified;<br/>With my heart and soul and all You gave to me I would give my life.</lines>
    </verse>
