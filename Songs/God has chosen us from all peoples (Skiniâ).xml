      <lines>Chorus:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When we are together - we are strong!<br/>When we are together - the Lord among us!<br/>When we are together - flows the love of God<br/>Pour down to us.</lines>

      <lines>We are the church, we are the body of Christ,<br/>We are redeemed by the blood of His!<br/>The gates of hell will not prevail against us,<br/>Because we are invincible!</lines>
