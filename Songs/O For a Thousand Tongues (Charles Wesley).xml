    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O for a thousand tongues to sing <br/>My great Redeemer’s praise, <br/>My great Redeemer’s praise! <br/>The glories of my God and King, <br/>The triumphs of His grace!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus! the name that charms our fears, <br/>That bids our sorrows cease, <br/>That bids our sorrows cease; <br/>’Tis music in the sinner’s ears, <br/>’Tis life, and health, and peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>See all your sins on Jesus laid; <br/>The Lamb of God was slain, <br/>The Lamb of God was slain; <br/>His soul was once an offering made <br/>For every soul of man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He breaks the power of cancelled sin, <br/>He sets the prisoner free, <br/>He sets the prisoner free; <br/>His blood can make the foulest clean, <br/>His blood availed for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He speaks and, listening to His voice, <br/>New life the dead receive, <br/>New life the dead receive; <br/>The mournful, broken hearts rejoice, <br/>The humble poor believe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb, <br/>Your loosened tongues employ, <br/>Your loosened tongues employ; <br/>Ye blind, behold your Saviour come; <br/>And leap, ye lame, for joy!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>My gracious Master and my God, <br/>Assist me to proclaim, <br/>Assist me to proclaim, <br/>To spread through all the earth abroad <br/>The honours of Thy name.</lines>
    </verse>
