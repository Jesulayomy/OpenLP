    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I am not skilled to understand<br/>What God has willed, what God has planned<br/>I only know at his right hand<br/>Stands one who is my Savior</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I take him at His word and deed<br/>Christ died to save me: this I read<br/>And in my heart I find a need<br/>Of Him to be my Savior</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>That He would leave His place on high<br/>And for sinful man to die<br/>You count it strange, so once did I<br/>Before I knew my Savior</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>My Savior Loves, my Savior Lives<br/>My Savior's always there for me<br/>My God; He was, my God; He is<br/>My God; is always gonna be</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Yes, living, dying: let me bring<br/>My Strength, my solace from this spring<br/>That He who lives to be my King<br/>Once died to be my Savior</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>My Savior Loves, my Savior Lives<br/>My Savior's always there for me<br/>My God; He was, my God; He is<br/>My God; is always gonna be</lines>
