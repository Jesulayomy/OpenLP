    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer<br/>Greatest treasure of my longing soul<br/>My God, like You there is no other<br/>True delight is found in You alone<br/>Your grace, a well too deep to fathom<br/>Your love exceeds the heavens' reach<br/>Your truth, a fount of perfect wisdom<br/>My highest good and my unending need</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer<br/>Strong defender of my weary heart<br/>My sword to fight the cruel deceiver<br/>And my shield against his hateful darts<br/>My song when enemies surround me<br/>My hope when tides of sorrow rise<br/>My joy when trials are abounding<br/>Your faithfulness, my refuge in the night</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer<br/>Gracious Savior of my ruined life<br/>My guilt and cross laid on Your shoulders<br/>In my place You suffered bled and died<br/>You rose, the grave and death are conquered<br/>You broke my bonds of sin and shame<br/>O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer<br/>May all my days bring glory to Your Name</lines>
