    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As for me, God came and found me<br/>As for me, He took me home<br/>As for me, He gave me a family<br/>And I never walk a**lone,<br/>In my life, I'm soaked in bless**ing<br/>And in heaven there's a great reward<br/>As for me and my house<br/>We're gonna serve the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I've got Jesus, Jesus, He calls me for His own<br/>And He lifts me, lifts me above the world I know<br/>God is in the house, there is no doubt<br/>God is in the house, Can't keep Him out<br/>As for you (As for you), As for me (As for me)<br/>We're gonna serve the Lord</lines>
