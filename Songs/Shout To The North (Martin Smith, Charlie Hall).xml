    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Men of faith, rise up and sing of the great and glorious King<br/>You are strong when you feel weak, in your brokenness, complete.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Shout to the north and the south! Sing to the east and the west!<br/>Jesus is Savior to all, Lord of heaven and earth!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Rise up women of the truth; stand and sing to broken hearts,<br/>Who can know the healing power of our glorious King of love?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>We've been through fire, we've been through rain;<br/>We've been refined by the pow'r of His name;<br/>We've fallen deeper in love with You;<br/>You've burned the truth on our lips.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Rise up church with broken wings; fill this place with songs again<br/>Of our God who reigns on high; by His grace again we'll fly.</lines>
