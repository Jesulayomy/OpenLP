    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Immortal, invisible, God only wise, In light inaccessible hid from our eyes, Most bless√®d, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light, Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might; Thy justice, like mountains, high soaring above Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>To all, life Thou givest, to both great and small; In all life Thou livest, the true life of all; We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree, And wither and perish but naught changeth Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Great Father of glory, pure Father of light, Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight; But of Thy rich graces this grace, Lord, impart Take the veil from our face, the vile from our heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>All laud we would render; O help us to see 'Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee, And so let Thy glory, almighty, impart, Through Christ in His story, Thy Christ to the heart.</lines>
    </verse>
