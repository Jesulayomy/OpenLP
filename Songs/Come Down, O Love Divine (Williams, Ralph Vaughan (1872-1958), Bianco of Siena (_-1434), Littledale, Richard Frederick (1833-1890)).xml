  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come down, O love divine, seek Thou this soul of mine, And visit it with Thine own ardor glowing. O Comforter, draw near, within my heart appear, And kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O let it freely burn, til earthly passions turn To dust and ashes in its heat consuming; And let Thy glorious light shine ever on my sight, And clothe me round, the while my path illuming.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Let holy charity mine outward vesture be, And lowliness become mine inner clothing; True lowliness of heart, which takes the humbler part, And o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And so the yearning strong, with which the soul will long, Shall far outpass the pow'r of human telling; For none can guess its grace, till he become the place Wherein the Holy Spirit makes His dwelling.</lines>
    </verse>
