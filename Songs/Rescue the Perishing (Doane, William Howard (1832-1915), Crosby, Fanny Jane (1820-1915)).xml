    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave; Weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen, Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save. Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting, Waiting the penitent child to receive; Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently; He will forgive they should only believe. Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter, Feelings lie buried that grace can restore; Touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness, Chords that were broken will vibrate once more. Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Rescue the perishing, duty demands it; Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide; Back to the narrow way patiently win them; Tell the poor wand'rer a Savior has died. Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.</lines>
