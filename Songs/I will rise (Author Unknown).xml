    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a peace I've come to know<br/>Though my heart and flesh may fail<br/>There's an anchor for my soul<br/>I can say "It is well"<br/>Jesus has overcome<br/>And the grave is overwhelmed<br/>The victory is won<br/>He is risen from the dead</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>And I will rise when He calls my name<br/>No more sorrow, no more pain<br/>I will rise on eagles' wings<br/>Before my God fall on my knees<br/>And rise<br/>I will rise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There's a day that's drawing near<br/>When this darkness breaks to light<br/>And the shadows disappear<br/>And my faith shall be my eyes<br/>Jesus has overcome<br/>And the grave is overwhelmed<br/>The victory is won<br/>He is risen from the dead</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>And I hear the voice of many angels sing,<br/>"Worthy is the Lamb"<br/>And I hear the cry of every longing heart,<br/>"Worthy is the Lamb" [x2]</lines>
