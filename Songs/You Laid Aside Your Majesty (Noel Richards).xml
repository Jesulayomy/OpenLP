    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You laid aside Your majesty<br/>Gave up everything for me<br/>Suffered at the hands<br/>Of those You had created<br/>You took all my guilt and shame<br/>When You died and rose again<br/>Now today You reign<br/>In heaven and earth exalted</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I really want to worship You, my Lord<br/>You have won my heart, and I am Yours<br/>For ever and ever I will love You<br/>You are the only one who died for me<br/>Gave Your life to set me free<br/>So I lift my voice to You in adoration</lines>
    </verse>
