    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Down the mountain the river flows<br/>And it brings refreshing wherever it goes.<br/>Through the valleys and over the fields,<br/>The river is rushing and the river is here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>The river of God sets our feet a-dancing,<br/>The river of God fills our hearts with cheer;<br/>The river of God fills our mouths with laughter,<br/>And we rejoice for the river is here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The river of God is teeming with life,<br/>And all who touch it can be revived.<br/>And those who linger on this river's shore<br/>Will come back thirsting for more of the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Up to the mountain we love to go<br/>To find the presence of the Lord.<br/>Along the banks of the river we run,<br/>We dance with laughter, giving praise to the Son.</lines>
    </verse>
