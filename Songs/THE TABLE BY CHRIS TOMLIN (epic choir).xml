      <lines>I will feast at the table of the Lord<br/>I will feast at the table of the Lord<br/>I won't hunger anymore<br/>At His table<br/>I will feast at the table of the Lord<br/>I will feast at the table of the Lord<br/>I won't hunger anymore<br/>At His table<br/>Come all you weary<br/>Come and find<br/>His yoke is easy<br/>His burden light<br/>He is able, He will restore<br/>At the table of the Lord<br/>There is peace at the table of the Lord<br/>There is peace at the table of the Lord<br/>And I won't worry anymore<br/>At His table<br/>There is healing at the table of the Lord<br/>There is healing at the table of the Lord<br/>Oh and I won't suffer anymore<br/>At His table oh at His table<br/>Come all you weary<br/>Come and find<br/>His yoke is easy<br/>His burden light<br/>He is able, He will restore<br/>At the table of the Lord<br/>Oh I know He has a place for me<br/>Oh, what joy will fill my heart<br/>With the saints around the mercy seat of God<br/>Come all you weary<br/>Come and find<br/>His yoke is easy<br/>His burden light<br/>He is able, He will restore<br/>At the table of the Lord<br/>At the table of the Lord<br/>I'm invited to the table of the Lord<br/>I'm invited to the table of the Lord<br/>He says, "Come just as you are"<br/>To His table</lines>
