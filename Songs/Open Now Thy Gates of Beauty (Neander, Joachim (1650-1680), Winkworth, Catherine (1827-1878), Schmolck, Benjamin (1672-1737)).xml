    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Open now thy gates of beauty, Zion, let me enter there, Where my soul in joyful duty Waits for Him Who answers prayer. Oh, how bless√®d is this place, Filled with solace, light and grace!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord, my God, I come before Thee, Come Thou also unto me; Where we find Thee and adore Thee, There a heav'n on earth must be. To my heart, oh, enter Thou, Let it be Thy temple now!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Here Thy praise is gladly chanted, Here Thy seed is duly sown; Let my soul, where it is planted, Bring forth precious sheaves alone, So that all I hear may be Fruitful unto life in me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thou my faith increase and quicken, Let me keep Thy gift divine, Howsoe'er temptations thicken; May Thy Word still o'er me shine As my guiding star through life, As my comfort in my strife.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Speak, O God, and I will hear Thee, Let Thy will be done indeed; May I undisturbed draw near Thee While Thou dost Thy people feed. Here of life the fountain flows, Here is balm for all our woes.</lines>
    </verse>
