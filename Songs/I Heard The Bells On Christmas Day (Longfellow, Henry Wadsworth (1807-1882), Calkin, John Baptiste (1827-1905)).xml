    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I heard the bells on Christmas day Their old familiar carols play, And wild and sweet the words repeat Of peace on earth, good will to men.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And thought how, as the day had come, The belfries of all Christendom Had rolled along th'unbroken song Of peace on earth, good will to men.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Till ringing, singing on its way The world revolved from night to day, A voice, a chime, a chant sublime Of peace on earth, good will to men.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And in despair I bowed my head "There is no peace on earth," I said, "For hate is strong and mocks the song Of peace on earth, good will to men."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: "God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; The wrong shall fail, the right prevail With peace on earth, good will to men."</lines>
    </verse>
