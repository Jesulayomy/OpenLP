    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We come in Your name<br/>For all things You have made<br/>And by Your Word all things You sustain<br/>The Lamb that was slain<br/>For our sins lives to reign<br/>The Lord of all, Name above all names!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We have been saved by faith<br/>Into Your glorious Name<br/>And this a gift of grace, freely given us<br/>Now all our sins are gone<br/>Defeated at the cross<br/>And we now live in You<br/>Raised with You by the power of God!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You have been lifted to the highest place<br/>And You now live and rule forever!<br/>We come to bring to You the highest praise<br/>For You are King of kings forever:<br/>Son of God, Jesus!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Holy is the Lamb<br/>Worthy of glory, worthy of honour<br/>High and lifted up and seated in majesty<br/>Your throne will last forever<br/>Your throne will last forever<br/>Your throne will last forevermore</lines>
