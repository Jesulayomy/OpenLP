    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I survey the wonderous Cross,<br/>On which the Prince of glory died,<br/>My richest gain I count but loss,<br/>And pour contempt on all my pride.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,<br/>Save in the death of Christ my God:<br/>All the vain things that charm me most,<br/>I sacrifice them to His blood.<br/>See from His head, His hands, His feet,<br/>Sorrow and love flow mingled down:<br/>Did eâ€™er such love and sorrow meet,<br/>Or thorns compose so rich a crown?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Were the whole realm of Nature mine,<br/>That were an offering far too small;<br/>Love so amazing, so divine,<br/>Demands my soul, my life, my all!</lines>
    </verse>
