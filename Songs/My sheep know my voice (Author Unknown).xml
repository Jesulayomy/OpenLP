    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My sheep know My voice,<br/>And the path that I take,<br/>They follow wherever I go;<br/>My sheep know My voice<br/>And come at My call,<br/>But a stranger's voice<br/>do they not know.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>CHORUS<br/>My sheep know My voice,<br/>And day by day,<br/>They abide in the fold,<br/>And go not astray;<br/>They love Me because<br/>I have made them My choice,<br/>And they follow My call,<br/>For My sheep know My voice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>My sheep know My voice,<br/>And the pastures of green,<br/>Where I lead them so often to feed;<br/>My sheep know My voice,<br/>And the cool sparkling stream,<br/>Where beside its still waters I lead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>My sheep know My voice,<br/>And the valley of death,<br/>Thru which I shall<br/>lead them some day;<br/>But no danger nor harm<br/>Can touch one of them,<br/>For I will be with them always.</lines>
