  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>    I keep trying to find a life on my own apart from You;<br/>I am the king of excuses; I've got one for every selfish thing I do.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The disease of self runs through my blood, it's a cancer fatal to my soul;<br/>Every attempt on my behalf has failed to bring this sickness under control.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>What's going on inside of me? I despise my own behavior;<br/>This only serves to confirm my suspicions that I'm still a man in need of a Savior.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I wanna be in the light as You are in the light.<br/>I wanna shine like the stars in the heavens.<br/>Oh Lord, be my light, and be my salvation,<br/>'Cause all I want is to be in the light,<br/>All I want is to be in the light.</lines>
    </verse>
