    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Wake, awake, for night is flying; The watchmen on the heights are crying: Awake, Jerusalem, at last! Midnight hears the welcome voices And at the thrilling cry rejoices; Come forth, ye virgins, night is past; The Bridegroom comes, awake; Your lamps with gladness take; Alleluia! And for His marriage feast prepare For ye must go and meet Him there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Zion hears the watchmen singing, And all her heart with joy is springing; She wakes, she rises from her gloom; For her Lord comes down all glorious, The strong in grace, in truth victorious. Her Star is ris'n, her Light is come. Ah come, Thou blessed One, God's own beloved Son: Alleluia! We follow till the halls we see Where Thou hast bid us sup with Thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now let all the heav'ns adore Thee, And saints and angels sing before Thee, With harp and cymbal's clearest tone; Of one pearl each shining portal, Where we are with the choir immortal Of angels round Thy dazzling throne; Nor eye hath seen, nor ear hath yet attained to hear What there is ours, but we rejoice and sing to Thee Our hymn of joy eternally.</lines>
