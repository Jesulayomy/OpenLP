    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The trials of this world were getting closer,<br/>The pull I felt was more than I could bear,<br/>And I was on the verge of giving over:<br/>The strength within myself just wasn't there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Chorus:<br/>Something keeps holding me,<br/>Everyday I see,<br/>He's helping me faithfully<br/>To overcome my trials;<br/>He's guiding me constantly,<br/>Giving me victory,<br/>He's a reality;<br/>Something keeps holding me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Satan lay before me his temptation<br/>Of his desire to steal away my faith,<br/>But I have found in time the revelation,<br/>The strength I need to keep me by His grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Chorus 2:<br/>Jesus is holding me,<br/>Everyday I see,<br/>He's helping me faithfully<br/>To overcome my trials;<br/>He's guiding me constantly,<br/>Giving me victory,<br/>He's a reality;<br/>Jesus is holding me.</lines>
