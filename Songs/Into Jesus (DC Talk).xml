  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I see the moon, a million stars are out tonight<br/>Gentle reminders of the way You are<br/>A sea of glass, a raging storm has come to pass<br/>You show Your face in an array of ways</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I know You're there, I feel Your love through my despair<br/>You speak the words that ease away the pain<br/>My heart is free, my eyes are clear, my soul is healed<br/>Now that You have got a hold on me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>My feet may venture to the ground<br/>But You will never let me down<br/>I can't hold it in, my soul is screaming!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Hey you, I'm into Jesus<br/>Hey you, I'm into Jesus, oh yeah<br/>Hey you, I'm into Jesus<br/>Hey you, I've seen the truth<br/>And I believe</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>And I believe</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>I still believe (2x)<br/>Hey you, this kid is back<br/>And I do declare that the Son is shining<br/>Hey you, the kid is back<br/>With a red alert 'cause it might be blinding<br/>Hey you, the kid is back<br/>And I do declare that the Son is shining<br/>Hey you, the kid is back<br/>My feet may venture to the ground...</lines>
