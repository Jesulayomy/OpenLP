    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who breaks the power of sin and darkness<br/>Whose love is mighty and so much stronger<br/>The King of Glory, the King above all kings<br/>Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder<br/>Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder<br/>The King of Glory, the King above all kings</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>This is amazing grace<br/>This is unfailing love<br/>That You would take my place<br/>That You would bear my cross<br/>You would lay down Your life<br/>That I would be set free<br/>Ohhh Jesus, I sing for<br/>All that You've done for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who brings our chaos back into order<br/>Who makes the orphan a son and daughter<br/>The King of Glory, the King above all kings<br/>Who rules the nations with truth and justice<br/>Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance<br/>The King of Glory, the King above all kings</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Worthy is the Lamb who was slain<br/>Worthy is the King who conquered the grave<br/>Worthy is the Lamb who was slain<br/>Worthy is the King who conquered the grave</lines>
    </verse>
