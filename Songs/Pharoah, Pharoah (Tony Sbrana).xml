    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Well, the burning bush told me just the other day<br/>That I should come over here and say<br/>Got to get my people out of Pharaoh's hand<br/>And lead them on over to the promised land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I say Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Oh baby<br/>Let my people go! Huh<br/>Yeah yeah yeah... (2X)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Well, all of God's people came to the Red Sea<br/>With Pharaoh's army coming after me<br/>I raised my rod, stuck it in the sand<br/>And all of God's people walked across dry land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Well all of Pharaoh's army was coming too<br/>So what do you think that I did do?<br/>I raised my rod and cleared my throat<br/>And all of Pharaoh's army did the dead man's float.</lines>
