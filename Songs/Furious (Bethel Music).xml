    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Nothing can tear us from<br/>The grip of His mighty love<br/>We've only glimpsed His vast affection<br/>Heard whispers of His heart and passion<br/>It's pouring down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His love is deep, His love is wide and it covers us<br/>His love is fierce, His love is strong, it is furious<br/>His love is sweet, His love is wild<br/>And it's waking hearts to life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Father loves and sends His son</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The Son lays down His life for all<br/>He lavishes His love upon us<br/>He calls us now, His sons and daughters</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He's reaching out<br/>And it's waking hearts to life<br/>He is waking hearts to life</lines>
    </verse>
