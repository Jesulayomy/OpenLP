      <lines>God is good all the time<br/>He put a song of praise<br/>In this heart of mine<br/>God is good all the time<br/>Through the darkest night<br/>His light will shine<br/>God is good<br/>God is good all the time</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>If you're walking through the valley<br/>and there are shadows all around<br/>Do not fear He will guide you<br/>He will keep you safe and sound<br/>He has promised to never leave you<br/>Nor forsake you<br/>And His Word is true</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We were sinners so unworthy<br/>Still for us He chose to die<br/>He filled us with His Holy Spirit<br/>Now we can stand and testify<br/>That His love is everlasting<br/>And His mercies<br/>they will never end</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Though I may not understand<br/>All the plans You have for me<br/>My life is in Your hands<br/>And through the eyes of faith<br/>I can clearly see</lines>
