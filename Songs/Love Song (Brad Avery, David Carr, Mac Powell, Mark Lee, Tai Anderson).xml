  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain<br/>Just to be with the one he loves.<br/>How many times has he broken that promise -<br/>It has never been done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>I've never climbed the highest mountain,<br/>but I walked the hill of Calvary...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Just to be with you, I would do anything;<br/>There's no price I would not pay.<br/>Just to be with you, I would give everything;<br/>I would give my life away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I've heard it said that a man would swim the ocean<br/>Just to be with the one he loves.<br/>Well all those dreams are an empty emotion -<br/>It can never be done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p2">
      <lines>I never swam the deepest oceans,<br/>but I walked upon the raging sea...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>And I know that you don't understand the fullness of my love,<br/>How I died upon the cross for your sins.<br/>And I know that you don't realize how much I gave you,<br/>And I promise I would do it all again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Just to be with you, I've done everything;<br/>Theres no price I did not pay.<br/>Just to be with you, I gave everything;<br/>Yes, I gave my life away.<br/>I gave my life away.</lines>
