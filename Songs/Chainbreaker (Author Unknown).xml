    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>If you've been walking the same old road for miles<br/>and miles<br/>If you've been hearing the same old voice tell the<br/>same old lies<br/>If you're trying to fill the same old holes inside<br/>There's a better life, There's a better life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>If you've got pain, He's a pain taker<br/>If you feel lost, He's a way maker<br/>If you need freedom or saving<br/>He's a prison shaking Savior<br/>If you got chains, He's a chain breaker</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We've all searched for the light of day in the dead<br/>of night<br/>We've all found ourselves worn out from the same<br/>old fight<br/>We've all run to things we know just ain't right<br/>When there's a better life, There's a better life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>If you believe it<br/>If you receive it<br/>If you can feel it<br/>Somebody testify</lines>
