    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All I once held dear, built my life upon<br/>All this world reveres, and wars to own<br/>All I once thought gain, I have counted loss<br/>Spent and worthless now, compared to this</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Knowing You, Jesus, knowing You<br/>There is no greater thing<br/>You're my all, You're the best<br/>You're my joy, my righteousness<br/>And I love You, Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now my heart's desire is to know You more<br/>To be found in You, and known as Yours<br/>To possess by faith what I could not earn<br/>All-surpassing gift of righteousness</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O to know the power of Your risen life<br/>And to know You in Your suffering<br/>To become like You in Your death, my Lord<br/>So with You to live and never die</lines>
    </verse>
