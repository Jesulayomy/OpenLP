    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You parents, hear what Jesus taught When little ones to him were brought: Forbid them not, but heed my plea Permitting them to come to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Obey your Lord and let his truth Be taught your children in their youth That they in church and school may dwell And learn their Savior's praise to tell.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For if you love them as you ought, To Christ your children will be brought. If thus you place them in his care, All in your family well shall fare.</lines>
