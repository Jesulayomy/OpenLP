    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Through all the changing scenes of life,<br/>In trouble and in joy,<br/>The praises of my God shall still<br/>My heart and tongue employ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Of His deliverance I will boast,<br/>Till all that are distressed<br/>From my example comfort take,<br/>And charm their griefs to rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O magnify the Lord with me,<br/>With me exalt His name;<br/>When in distress to Him I called,<br/>He to my rescue came.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The hosts of God encamp around<br/>The dwellings of the just;<br/>Deliverance He affords to all<br/>Who on His succour trust.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>O make but trial of His love;<br/>Experience will decide<br/>How blest are they, and only they,<br/>Who in His truth confide.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then<br/>Have nothing else to fear;<br/>Make you His service your delight;<br/>Your wants shall be His care.</lines>
    </verse>
