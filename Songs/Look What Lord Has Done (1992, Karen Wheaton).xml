      <lines>I was bound by chains of darkness and sin<br/>I had no hope or peace of mind<br/>Though my sins were red as scarlet<br/>He washed them white as snow<br/>And opened my blind eyes<br/>Now my soul will rejoice since I've made Him my choice<br/>I've got joy, peace, everything that's within<br/>You see my names been written down<br/>In the lambs book of life<br/>Can't you see what Gods done for me.</lines>
