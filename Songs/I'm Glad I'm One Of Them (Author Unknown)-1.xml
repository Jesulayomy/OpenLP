    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There are people almost everywhere,<br/>Whose hearts are all aflame,<br/>With the fire that fell at Pentecost,<br/>Which cleansed and made them clean;<br/>It is burning now within my heart,<br/>All glory to His name!<br/>I'm so glad that I can say<br/>I'm one of them!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>CHORUS<br/>One of them, one of them,<br/>I'm so glad that I can say<br/>I'm one of them!<br/>One of them, one of them,<br/>I'm so glad that I can say<br/>I'm one of them!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Though these people may not<br/>learned be,<br/>Nor boast of worldly fame,<br/>They have all received their Pentecost,<br/>Baptized in Jesus' name;<br/>And are telling now, both far and wide,<br/>His pow'r is yet the same,<br/>I'm so glad that I can say<br/>I'm one of them!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>They were gathered in the upper room,<br/>All praying in His name,<br/>They were baptized with the<br/>Holy Ghost,<br/>And pow'r for service came;<br/>Now what He did for them that day<br/>He'll do for you the same;<br/>I'm so glad that I can say<br/>I'm one of them!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come, my brother, seek this blessing<br/>That will cleanse your heart from sin,<br/>That will start the joy-bells ringing<br/>And will keep the soul aflame;<br/>It is burning now within my heart,<br/>All glory to His name,<br/>I'm so glad that I can say<br/>I'm one of them!</lines>
