      <lines>Verse 1<br/>In the presence of my enemies<br/>When the storm is crashing down on me<br/>I will trust in what I cannot see<br/>I wait for You, I wait for You</lines>

    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Bridge<br/>My hope is built on nothing less<br/>Than Jesus blood and righteousness<br/>When darkness seems to hide His face<br/>I rest in His unchanging grace<br/>In every high and stormy gale<br/>My anchor holds within the veil<br/>On Christ the solid rock I stand<br/>All other ground is sinking sand!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>Chorus<br/>I know, nothing is impossible<br/>I know, every chain is breakable<br/>I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand!<br/>My fear, is conquered by His perfect love<br/>My life, is ransomed by His royal blood<br/>I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand!</lines>
