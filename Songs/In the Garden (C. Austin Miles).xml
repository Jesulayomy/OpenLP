    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I come to the garden alone, While the dew is still on the roses;<br/>And the voice I hear falling on my ear, The Son of God discloses.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And He walks with me, and He talks with me,<br/>And He tells me I am His own;<br/>And the joy we share as we tarry there,<br/>None other has ever known.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He speaks, and the sound of His voice Is so sweet the birds hush their singing;<br/>And the melody that He gave to me, Within my heart is ringing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I'd stay in the garden with Him, Though the night around me be falling;<br/>But He bids me go; thru the voice of woe, His voice to me is calling.</lines>
    </verse>
