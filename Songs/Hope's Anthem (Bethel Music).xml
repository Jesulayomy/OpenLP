    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He's awakening the hope in me<br/>By calling forth my destiny<br/>He's breathing life into my soul<br/>I will thirst for Him, and him alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He has come like the rain<br/>That showers on the barren plain<br/>So my heart and tongue confess<br/>Jesus Christ, the hope of man</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>My hope is in you, God<br/>I am steadfast, I will not be moved<br/>I'm anchored, never shaken<br/>All my hope is in you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>BRIDGE:<br/>He's bringing hope to the hopeless<br/>And giving his heart to the broken<br/>And sharing his home with the orphan</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He is the joy, He is my joy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He is the hope of the nations<br/>The Father's heart we're embracing<br/>He is the song we're declaring<br/>He is the joy, He is my joy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>You're bringing hope to the hopeless<br/>And giving your heart to the broken<br/>And sharing your home with the orphan<br/>You are the joy, You are my joy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>You are the hope of the nations<br/>The Father's heart we're embracing<br/>You are the song we're declaring<br/>You are the joy, You are my joy<br/>Why so downcast oh, oh my soul<br/>Put your hope in God alone</lines>
