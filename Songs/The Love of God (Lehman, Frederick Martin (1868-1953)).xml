    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The love of God is greater far Than tongue or pen can ever tell, It goes beyond the highest star, And reaches to the lowest hell; The guilty pair, bowed down with care, God gave His Son to win; His erring child, He reconciled, And pardoned from his sin. Oh love of God, how rich and pure! How measureless and strong! It shall forevermore endure, The saints' and angels' song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When hoary time shall pass away, And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall; When men who here refuse to pray, On rocks and hills and mountains call; God's love, so sure, shall still endure, All measureless and strong; Redeeming grace to Adam's race\The saints' and angels' song. Oh love of God, how rich and pure! How measureless and strong! It shall forevermore endure, The saints' and angels' song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Could we with ink the ocean fill,And were the skies of parchment made, Were every stalk on earth a quill And every man a scribe by trade; To write the love of God above Would drain the ocean dry; Nor could the scroll contain the whole, Tho' stretched from sky to sky. Oh love of God, how rich and pure! How measureless and strong! It shall forevermore endure, The saints' and angels' song.</lines>
