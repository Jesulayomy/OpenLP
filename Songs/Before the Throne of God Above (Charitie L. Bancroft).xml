    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Before the throne of God above,<br/>I have a strong, a perfect plea,<br/>A great High Priest whose name is Love,<br/>Who ever lives and pleads for me.<br/>My name is graven on His hands,<br/>My name is written on His heart;<br/>I know that while in heaven He stands <br/>No tongue can bid me thence depart,<br/>No tongue can bid me thence depart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When Satan tempts me to despair,<br/>And tells me of the guilt within,<br/>Upward I look and see Him there <br/>Who made an end to all my sin.<br/>Because the sinless Saviour died,<br/>My sinful soul is counted free;<br/>For God the Just is satisfied<br/>To look on Him and pardon me,<br/>To look on Him and pardon me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Behold Him there! The risen Lamb,<br/>My perfect, spotless righteousness;<br/>The great unchangeable I AM,<br/>The King of glory and of grace!<br/>One with Himself I cannot die,<br/>My soul is purchased with His blood;<br/>My life is hid with Christ on high,<br/>With Christ, my Saviour and my God,<br/>With Christ my Saviour and my God.</lines>
