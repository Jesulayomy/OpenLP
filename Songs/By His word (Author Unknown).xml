    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It is written that man<br/>shall not live by bread alone<br/>But by every word that comes<br/>from the mouth of God<br/>And by his word he gave His son<br/>for us on Calvary<br/>To pay the price of sin for you and for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>By His word<br/>He raised the sick man from the bed<br/>By His word<br/>He gave life unto the dead By His word<br/>He brings hope to the hopeless soul<br/>By His word<br/>You can have the victory<br/>By His word<br/>He will set the captive free By His word<br/>He brings life to you and me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Just one word was broken in Eden<br/>And that's what caused the fall<br/>So it will take all of the word<br/>To bring us back to God<br/>And through this last day message<br/>All His word has been made known<br/>And through His power we shall overcome</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>By His word<br/>He spoke and squirrels did appear<br/>By His word<br/>Storm go back from where you came<br/>By His word<br/>Little fishie Jesus gives you back your life<br/>By His word<br/>He spoke the tumor out of existence<br/>By His word<br/>He gave two boys salvation By His word<br/>He gave life to you and me</lines>
