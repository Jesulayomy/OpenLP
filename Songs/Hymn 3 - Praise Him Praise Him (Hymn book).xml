    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise Him, Praise Him! Jesus our blessed redeemer;<br/>Sing, O earth, His wonderful love proclaim! <br/>Hail Him, hail Him! highest archangels in glory, <br/>Strength and honour give to His holy name. <br/>Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children, <br/>In His arms He carries them all day long; <br/>O ye saints that dwell in the mountains of Zion, <br/>Praise Him! praise Him! ever in joyful song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Praise Him, praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer; <br/>For our sins He suffered and bled and died. <br/>He, our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation, <br/>Hail Him, hail Him! Jesus the Crucified. <br/>Loving Saviour, meekly enduring sorrow, <br/>Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow; <br/>Once for us rejected, despised, and forsaken, <br/>Prince of glory, ever triumphant now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Praise Him, praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer; <br/>Heavenly portals loud with hosannas ring! <br/>Jesus, Saviour, reigneth for ever and ever, <br/>Crown Him, crown Him! Prophet and Priest and King! <br/>Death is vanquished, tell it with joy, ye faithful! <br/>Where is now thy victory, boasting grave? <br/>Jesus lives, no longer thy portals are cheerless; <br/>Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.</lines>
