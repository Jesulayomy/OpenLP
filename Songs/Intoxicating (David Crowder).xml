    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Intoxicating You are to me.<br/>Illuminating You are to see.<br/>Truly breathtaking You are to breathe<br/>Sending my head swimming You are You see.<br/>And I've lost my mind I'm sure I'll find<br/>Need to apologize for my lack of inhibition<br/>For my belligerent condition<br/>But with You this near I'm dizzy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Inebriating You are to me.<br/>Completely captivating to see.<br/>Sending my world spinning You are You see<br/>And now I find a blurry line<br/>Here between You and I<br/>Raise the cup drink 'til I'm full<br/>Sing 'til I can't 'til my voice is gone<br/>And my head is spinning</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>La la dee da, la dee da dee da, dee da da da<br/>Hey la la dee da, la dee da dee da, dee da da da</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Illuminating You are to see.<br/>Truly breathtaking You are to breathe<br/>Sending my head swimming You are You see.<br/>And now I find a blurry line<br/>Here between You and I<br/>Raise the cup drink 'til I'm full<br/>Sing 'til I can't 'til my voice is gone<br/>And my head is spinning</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>If I'm out of my mind it's You, You<br/>'Cause I'm crazy in love with You, You<br/>Inebriated by You, You.</lines>
