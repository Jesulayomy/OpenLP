    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Love unfailing, overtaking my heart.  You take me in.<br/>Finding peace again, fear is lost in all You are.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>And I would give the world to tell Your story<br/>'Cause I know that You've called me,<br/>I know that You've called me.<br/>I've lost myself for good within Your promise,<br/>And I won't hide it, I won't hide it.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Jesus, I believe in You and I would go<br/>To the ends of the earth, to the ends of the earth.<br/>For You alone are the Son of God<br/>And all the world will see<br/>That You are God, You are God</lines>
