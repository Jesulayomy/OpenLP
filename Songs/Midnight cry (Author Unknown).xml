    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Saints of all the ages that's gone by,<br/>Longed to see this happ'ning in their time,<br/>But they died in faith anticipating for the day,<br/>Which is GOING ON now,<br/>In this finishing hour.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Chorus<br/>There was a midnight cry:<br/>The Bridegroom's drawing nigh!<br/>There will be a rapture<br/>In the twinkling of an eye.<br/>Come, trim the lamp of your heart now,<br/>Let the Love of Christ shine bright in you<br/>Let His Life in you abide -<br/>Jesus Christ is revealed in His Bride.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Darkness holds the world in deadly grip,<br/>People's hearts are in religious sleep,<br/>But there's a holy and elected nation pure and<br/>right,<br/>For the harvest is ripe,<br/>Fields are ready and white.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The glorious and spotless, sinless Bride<br/>Ready to be standing by His side<br/>She is given the fine linen of righteousness of<br/>saints,<br/>The perfection of Christ<br/>Can be seen in their lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>How we cherish the Message from God!<br/>Let us sing a new song to the Lord<br/>It's a sign to all the nations<br/>The Divine manifestation,<br/>For we have a revelation - who we are.</lines>
