    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the darkness we were waiting<br/>Without hope, without light<br/>Till from heaven You came running<br/>There was mercy in Your eyes<br/>To fulfil the law and prophets<br/>To a virgin came the Word<br/>From a throne of endless glory<br/>To a cradle in the dirt</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Praise the Father, praise the Son<br/>Praise the Spirit three in one<br/>God of glory, Majesty<br/>Praise forever to the King of Kings</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To reveal the kingdom coming<br/>And to reconcile the lost<br/>To redeem the whole creation<br/>You did not despise the Cross<br/>For e-ven in your suffering<br/>You saw to the other side<br/>Knowing this was our salvation<br/>Jesus for our sake You died</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And the morning that You rose<br/>All of heaven held its breath<br/>Till that stone was moved for good<br/>For the Lamb had conquered death<br/>And the dead rose from their tombs<br/>And the angels stood in awe<br/>For the souls of all who'd come<br/>To the Father are restored</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And the church of Christ was born<br/>Then the Spirit lit the flame<br/>Now this gospel truth of old<br/>Shall not kneel, shall not faint<br/>By His blood and in His name<br/>In His freedom I am free<br/>For the love of Jesus Christ<br/>Who has resurrected me</lines>
    </verse>
