    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the secret, in the quiet place,<br/>In the stillness, You are there.<br/>In the secret, in the quiet hour<br/>I wait, only for You,<br/>'Cause I want to know You more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I want to know You, I want to hear Your voice;<br/>I want to know You more.<br/>I want to touch You, I want to see Your face;<br/>I want to know You more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I am reaching for the highest goal,<br/>That I might receive the prize.<br/>Pressing onward, pushing every hindrance<br/>aside, out of my way,<br/>'Cause I want to know You more.</lines>
    </verse>
